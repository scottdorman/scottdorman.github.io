Recreate or link to special-purpose folders in OneDrive from the Web.
Like your user home folder in Windows, Microsoft populates your OneDrive online file-hosting folder with some default special-purpose folders. You may not have all of them without using special apps first and they can be tricky to recreate if they get lost. Here is a list of all the special folders and links for recreating them.

If you’ve deleted any of these or haven’t used any of the apps that automatically create them, you can follow the above links to create them in your OneDrive account. Manually creating folders with the correct names in OneDrive may not be enough to fully restore them depending on your account history and localization settings on your PC. I would recommend you rename them on the OneDrive website and wait for it to sync to your clients to avoid these issues.
