There are lots of pages that use some sort of JavaScript or jQuery plugin to provide a "go to top" feature. I'm sure you've seen it: As you scroll down the page, a little arrow appears somewhere near the bottom that lets you easily jump back to the top.

For me, there never seemed to be any really good plugins to do this. Yes, there are lots of different ways to accomplish this, and some are easier than others, but there wasn't a simple, small, and easy plugin â€“ until now.

jQuery-goTop is a very small (the minified JavaScript file is about 1.3 KB) scroll to top jQuery plugin. A live [demo](http://scottdorman.github.io/jquery-gotop) is available along with documentation on how to use it. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottdorman/jquery-gotop) and packages are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jquery-gotop/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-gotop), and [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=jquery-gotop).

Feel free to check it out, use it, provide [feedback](https://github.com/scottdorman/jquery-gotop/issues), and enjoy.
