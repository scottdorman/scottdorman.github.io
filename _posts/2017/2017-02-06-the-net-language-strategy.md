title: The .NET Language Strategy
---

Last week, Microsoft announced the [language strategy](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/01/the-net-language-strategy/) for C#, VB, and F#. The Visual Basic team also provided a [more detailed look at the Visual Basic .NET language strategy](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vbteam/2017/02/01/digging-deeper-into-the-visual-basic-language-strategy/).

So much has changed in .NET, especially over the last year, but one of the changes that has had the most impact has been the open sourcing of the [whole .NET stack](https://github.com/dotnet/). With the language strategy posts, Microsoft has provided some additional context for _how_ language decisions are made. That means the design process for the languages is now completely out in the open on GitHub.

This includes the C# and VB language specs. This is a huge achievement and one that I'm personally very happy to see. This effort started back in August 2014 when I started working with Lucian on the VB spec, mostly converting the existing Word spec to markdown.  

The C# design process is in the [dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) GitHub repository and design discussions happen on the [csharplang](https://lists.dot.net/mailman/listinfo/csharplang) mailing list.

The Visual Basic design process is in the [dotnet/vblang](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang) GitHub repository and design discussions happen on the [vblang](https://lists.dot.net/mailman/listinfo/vblang) mailing list.

The F# language design process is in the [fsharp/fslang-suggestions](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions) and [fsharp/fslang-design](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design) GitHub repositories.
