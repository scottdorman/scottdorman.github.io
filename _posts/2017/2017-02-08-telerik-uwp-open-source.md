The [Windows Developer Day - Creators Update](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/campaigns/windows-developer-day?wt.mc_id=w10cu_blog_bafw_null_null_post_recap&ocid=w10cu_blog_bafw_null_null_post_recap&utm_campaign=w10cu&utm_source=bafw&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=blogpostrecap) was today and if you're a Windows developer, the event did not disappoint.

One of the bigger announcements today didn't come from Microsoft though. Instead, it came from Progress, the makers of the powerful Telerik controls. Nearly 3 years ago, the [Telerik Kendo UI Core](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core) was released as open source. Today, Progress did it again by announcing [Telerik UI for UWP is now open source](http://www.telerik.com/blogs/telerik-ui-for-uwp-now-open-source) under the Apache Software License (ASLv2) and is available for download for FREE. The [UI for UWP repo on GitHub](https://github.com/telerik/UI-For-UWP) is now available to the public.

In case you aren't familiar with UI for UWP, it's a suite of 20+ UI controls for developers building UWP applications. Be sure to check the [full list of available controls](http://www.telerik.com/universal-windows-platform-ui).

In the last year, Windows 10 has seen growing adoption among desktop users and is now the second most used OS in the world, making up [about 25% of the market](https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0).

Making UI for UWP open source makes an exceptionally strong statement from both Progress and Microsoft about the future of software development and developer tools.
