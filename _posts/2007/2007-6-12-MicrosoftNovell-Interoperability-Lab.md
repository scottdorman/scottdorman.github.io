Earlier this year Microsoft created the Microsoft/Novell Interoperability Lab. A few days ago they quietly hired Tom Hanrahan, the former Director of Engineering for the Linux Foundation, to become their Director of Linux Interoperability.

According to Sam Ramji, Microsoft's Director of Platform Technology Strategy, the Interoperability Lab "will focus on interoperable virtualization between Windows and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server."
