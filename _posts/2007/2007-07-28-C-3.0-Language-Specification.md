The [C# Unified Language Specification](http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc) is now available for review. If you are wondering why it is called the "Unified" language specification, it pulls together information from the C# 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0 specifications into a single unified document.
