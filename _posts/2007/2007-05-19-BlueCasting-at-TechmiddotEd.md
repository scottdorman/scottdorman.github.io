Last time it was RFID, this time it's Bluetooth. If you have a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device, you have the opportunity to receive content on it. What this content actually is hasn't been mentioned yet, but hopefully it will involve useful things like schedule changes and other important information. All you need to do is set your device's Bluetooth setting to "Discoverable". Of course, hopefully you'll remember to bring a charger and plug in every night to recharge.
