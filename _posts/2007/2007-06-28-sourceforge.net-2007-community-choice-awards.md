I know I'm a little late to the nomination party, but if you haven't already nominated your favorite SourceForge project, please take the time to do so. It only takes a minute, and the Subtext development community would definitely appreciate it. 

> The SourceForge.net team is proud to present our second annual Community Choice Awards. Winners are selected by community members like you, and it's that time again! Cast a ballot for your favorite projects now and make your voice heard.

The Community Choice Awards are a chance for the open source software *users* to nominate and then vote on the projects that they find most useful.

Nominations end on June 29th, but if you miss the nomination period you can still vote. Voting runs from July 9th - 26th.
