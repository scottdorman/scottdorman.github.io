To go along with my [FeedBurner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScottDorman) subscription, I am now offering [Windows Live Alerts](http://alerts.live.com/) from my blog. Look for the subscription logo on my blog, just under the FeedBurner subscription panel. 

Windows Live Alerts is a great way for you to be automatically notified through a desktop alert, email, PDA, and/or cell phone whenever I update my blog and gives you, my readers, control over when and where you receive information.

If you want to add alerts to your own blog, it is a very simple process. Here's what you need to do:

1.  [Fill out a quick form including RSS feed URL.](http://signup.alerts.live.com/alerts/editSignup.do?)
2.  You'll receive a confirmation from Windows Live Alerts and will need to click the link in the email to accept the terms of use.
3.  A few days after that, you will receive a second email with the specific HTML code you need to use for your "Sign Up" link.
4.  After you add the "Sign Up" link, you should test the subscription. 

After that, your readers will be able to authenticate themselves and can chose how they want to receive updates, and can modify their settings or opt out at any time. Whenever you update your blog, Windows Live Alerts will automatically send a headline to your readers. Clicking the headline takes readers to your blog.
