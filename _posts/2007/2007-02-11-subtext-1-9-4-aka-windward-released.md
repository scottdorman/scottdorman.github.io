The long awaited 1.9.4 release is finally here. This release fixes a number of bugs and implements a few new features. One of the more significant features is the [Sitemap](http://sitemaps.org) implementation. You can find more information on the implementation and instructions on how to set it up on [David's](http://vidmar.net/weblog/archive/2007/01/31/Subtext-1.9.4--now-with-sitemap.aspx)Â blog.

There is also a new set of [XFN icons](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/01/20/XFN_Microformat__with_Icon_Goodness.aspx) to go along with [Subtext's XFN Highlighter](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/05/MakingMicroformatsMoreVisibleAnnouncingTheXFNHighlighterScript.aspx). I think the new icons and highlighter will work very well with my new [XFN Link Editor]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-10-xfn-live-writer-plugin-updates %}) for Windows Live Writer (once it finally gets approved by the Windows Live Gallery people).

You can [download](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896) the latest release from the Subtext [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtext/) site.
