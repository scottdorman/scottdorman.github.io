There are 14 core tracks and 2 virtual tracks at Tech·Ed this year, which will cover more than 1,000 sessions. In case you're wondering, a virtual track is a collection of sessions or labs that share a common theme but span several tracks.

Microsoft has revised the technical tracks slightly since my original [post]({% post_url 2007-02-17-techmiddoted-technical-tracks-summary %}), so I have updated my summary.
