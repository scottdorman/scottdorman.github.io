Short on the heals of the Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 [release]({% post_url /2007/2007-07-28-Visual-Studio-2008-Beta-2---Now-Available %}), we will soon have the first public Community Technology Preview (CTP) of Visual Studio "Rosario".Â  According to [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/), Microsoft product unit manager for Team Foundation Server, Microsoft has been working on Rosario since September of last year. The result *should* be a shorter time period between the 2008 release and the Rosario release.

There aren't many details about what will be included in the Rosario release, but the CTP should be available sometime this month as a Virtual PC (VPC) download. There should be a second CTP release around November as well.
