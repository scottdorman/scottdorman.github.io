As I was writing my previous [post]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-18-strange-metaweblog-bug %}), I found an odd spelling correction suggested by the Windows Live Writer spell checker. It would appear that the suggested spelling for MSBuild is [Sybil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Ardell_Mason). That might just explain things.
