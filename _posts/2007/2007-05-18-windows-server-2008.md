Windows Server "Longhorn" has officially been named Windows Server 2008. To go along with the name change, Microsoft has made Beta 3 publicly available for download.

You can download it from either the [TechNet Beta Central](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/beta/lhs/default.mspx) site, or the [MSDN Evaluation Center](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/evalcenter/bb383571.aspx) site. You can also order it on DVD.
