Even though this is my fourth Tech·Ed, it is the first time I'll be attending the Party with Palermo pre-event party. This sounds like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I'll probably be a little bit late, but I doubt it will take away from festivities. There is an estimated 300 people attending and some great sponsors.

The cover charge is one business card, which will get you in the door and register you for the grand prize drawings. This is free to attend, with free food, drink, and swag.
