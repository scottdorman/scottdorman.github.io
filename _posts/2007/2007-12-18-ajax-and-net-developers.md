My friend [Simone](http://codeclimber.net.nz/) has created an interesting [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=08SQvBq_2b7IuNd14d88ywJg_3d_3d) focused on .NET developers and Ajax. It's a more focused response to this [survey](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/12/18/ASP.NET-Ajax-usage-floats-around-35.aspx) on the [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/) blog. As of 2 AM (in Italy), there have been 415 responses:

*   ASP.NET Ajax: 80%
*   AJAX Control Toolkit: 17%
*   JQuery: 13%
*   raw Ajax: 12%  

If you are a .NET developer and are working with Ajax be sure to take the survey.
