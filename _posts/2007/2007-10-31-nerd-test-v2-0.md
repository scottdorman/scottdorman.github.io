It's only been 6 months since I took the first version of the Nerd Test...

NerdTests.com says I'm a Dorky Nerd King! [What are you?](http://www.nerdtests.com/nt2ref.html)

Quick Fun Facts (so far):

*   **177255** *unique* people have taken this test.  
*   **44.8%** of test takers are gals, **53.1%** are guys...the rest (2.1%) are confused.  
*   **17.1%** of test takers get aroused by "iPhone", while **40.6%** get utterly ill.  
*   **34.6%** of all test takers would choose the Internet over sex, and  
*   **28.3%** of *married* test takers prefer the Internet over sex.  
*   **3.6%** of test takers own a Jar Jar Binks T-shirt, though **56.0%** of them don't own a lightsaber (priorities == messed up).
