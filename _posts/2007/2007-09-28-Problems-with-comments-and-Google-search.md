title: Problems with comments and Google search

I had recently added a Google search box to my blog to allow easier searches on both Google and the Geekswithblogs site itself. However, it seems to have caused a problem today that was preventing people from leaving comments on any of my posts. After much trial and error, I was able to track the problem down to this search box and have removed it from my blog.

For those that tried to leave comments today, apologies to all and hopefully you will try again now that everything seems to be working again.
