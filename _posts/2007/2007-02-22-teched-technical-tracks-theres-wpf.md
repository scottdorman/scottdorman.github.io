Earlier this month, I posted a [summary]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-teched-technical-tracks-summary %}) of the [technical tracks](http://www.msteched.com/public/tracks.aspx) available for TechEd 2007. As I was putting the summary together, I noticed that WPF was not listed. Well, [Rob Relyea,](http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com/) the PM on the WPF team noticed my [post]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-teched-technical-tracks-wheres-wpf %}) and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is now officially listed under the "Developer Tools and Technologies" track.
