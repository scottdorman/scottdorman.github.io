Just yesterday I mentioned that I updated my [FileDownloader](http://www.codeproject.com/cs/library/filedownloader.asp) article and class on The Code Project. In that post, I mentioned that there was another update pending that added the ability to set the **User-agent** HTTP header. I received the notification from The Code Project this morning that they have updated the article so this new feature is included in the download. Remember, these changes are only available in the .NET 2.0 version of the class.
