I [mentioned]({% post_url 2007-11-06-Windows-Live-Wave-2-Released %}) yesterday that the latest wave of Windows Live applications have been released. Thinking about it a little bit more, I realized that other than the "Beta" tag being removed from the splash screens and/or title bars there is no way to know if you have the latest version. Here are the release version numbers for the Windows Live applications:

|**Windows Live Application**|**Release Version**|
|---|---|
|Messenger|Version 2008 (Build 8.5.1302.1018)|
|Mail|Version 2008 (Build 12.0.1606)|
|Writer|Version 2008 (Build 12.0.1366.1026)|
|Photo Gallery|Version 2008 (Build 12.0.1308.1023)|
|Toolbar|Feed Detector: 03.01.0000.0073  
Form Fill: 03.01.0000.0072  
Windows Live Toolbar: 03.01.0000.0146  
Windows Live Toolbar Custom Buttons: 03.01.0000.0146  
Windows Live Toolbar Search Box: 03.01.0000.0146|
|OneCare Family Safety|Version 2008 (Build 2.0.5817.2)|

As you can see, everything except the Windows Live Toolbar is now Version 2008 but with different build numbers.
