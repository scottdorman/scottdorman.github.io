[eWEEK Labs](http://www.eweek.com/slideshow/0,1206,pg=0&s=25947&a=206265,00.asp "http://www.eweek.com/slideshow/0,1206,pg=0&s=25947&a=206265,00.asp") has named the 18 most important open-source applications. These are applications that have helped make open-source technologies integral enterprise tools. In no particular order, here they are:

*   Apache
*   Linux Kernel
*   Nessus
*   Firefox
*   Perl
*   Wireshark
*   PHP
*   VNC
*   BSD
*   Webmin
*   Asterisk
*   Nmap
*   OpenOffice.org
*   MySQL
*   Nagios
*   Eclipse
*   Samba
*   OpenSSH and OpenSSL 

I think this is a pretty comprehensive list, and there are only a few on here that I haven't heard of before.
