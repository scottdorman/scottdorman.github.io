The [Windows Vista UX Guide](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx) is probably the most comprehensive UX guide that Microsoft has published. The big drawback has been that it was only available online through MSDN. Fortunately, as of today, the UX Guide is now available as a [PDF](http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/1/9/e191fd8c-bce8-4dba-a9d5-2d4e3f3ec1d3/ux%20guide.pdf) document so you can read all 627 pages of it offline.
