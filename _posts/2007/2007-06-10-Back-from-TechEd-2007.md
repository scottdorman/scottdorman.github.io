Going from one extreme to another can be just a bit disconcerting. After spending a week in Alaska where I was almost completely disconnected from the world, I went straight into Tech·Ed 2007.

If you weren't able to attend, make sure to check out [Virtual Tech·Ed](http://www.virtualteched.com/Pages/default.aspx). You will find the keynote and some podcasts relating to some of the sessions. Things are about a week behind and there are a lot of podcasts queued up to be made available on the site, so keep checking back.

I can't say that there was a main technology focus this year, but there was a big presence for Microsoft [Forefront](http://www.microsoft.com/forefront/default.mspx), [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/default01.aspx), [Office 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx), [Windows Server 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/default.mspx), [Visual Studio 2008](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx), and the [.NET 3.0 technologies](http://www.microsoft.com/net/).

There have been a lot of posts complaining about different things from the conference, so I'm not going to go repeat what everyone else has said. I'm also not going to say one way or the other if I agree with everything that was said.

As a result of my Birds of a Feather session (which I think went very well...I should know my evaluation scores sometime next week), I will be starting a regular series of posts on code standards and styles. Be sure to check it out.

Also, I'll be posting pictures from both Tech·Ed and Alaska very shortly. The Tech·Ed pictures will be on my blog. I haven't decided where the Alaska pictures will live as there are about 1400 of them.
