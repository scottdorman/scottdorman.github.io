title: .NET Framework version detection updated for .NET 3.5 Beta 2

My [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/frameworkversiondetection.asp) on using managed code to detect what versions and service packs of the .NET Framework are installed on a system has been updated to account for a minor registry change between the January 2007 CTP and Beta 2. Along with that article, the [article](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/iisdetection.asp) on using managed code to detect if IIS is installed and ASP or ASP.NET is registered has also been updated with the same fix.
