While searching for some blog search engines and aggregators to add to my list of ping servers in Windows Live Writer, I came across [autopinger](http://autopinger.com/).

> AutoPinger is a **FREE** and convenient service for all bloggers and podcasters. It is an easy **set-and-forget** service that lets concentrate more on developing your favourite blogs and podcasts...Autopinger will check your blogs and podcast feeds every 30 mins.

This is a pretty neat idea, and they do provide an [XML-RPC interface](http://autopinger.com/about/blog_ping_interfaces.aspx) in addition to allowing you to register in order to get the automatic ping action and getting the {% include post/image.html image-file="o-quickping.gif" alt="" %}Â badge to put on your blog.
