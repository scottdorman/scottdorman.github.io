[Phil Haack](http://haacked.com) was interviewed at MIX07 by [Tim Heuer](http://timheuer.com/blog/) for his new [TimCast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/timcast-all) podcast. In the interview, which lasts about 7 minutes, Phil explains how he got started working on Subtext, and open source in general. About half-way through the interview, Tim asks about the community support for Subtext, and he mentions the work [Simone Chiaretta](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz) and I did on the Subtext build dashboard...even mentioning us by name. You can download the [audio](http://s3.amazonaws.com/timcast/MIX07-PhilHaack.mp3) for the interview and read the [original announcement](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-i-am-a-terrible-at-being-interviewed.aspx) at Phil's blog.

It's great to see that Subtext is receiving a good deal of notice lately. And thank you, Phil, for the mention in the interview.
