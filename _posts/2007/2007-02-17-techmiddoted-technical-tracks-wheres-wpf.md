title: Tech&middot;Ed Technical Tracks - Where's WPF?

I was scanning through the list of [technical tracks](http://www.msteched.com/public/tracks.aspx) for Tech·Ed this morning and noticed an odd omission. Windows Presentation Found (WPF) is only listed once, under the "Connected Systems" track:

> Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 programming model for Windows that offers new technologies for building applications for seamless communication across technology boundaries and for composing services. These new technologies are Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, and Windows CardSpace. **(The latter three are covered in this track.)**

The emphasis is mine. This is the only place WPF is mentioned, and then Microsoft goes on to say that it isn't actually covered in this track. Hopefully this was either an oversight or it will be covered as part of Visual Studio Orcas in the "Developer Tools and Technologies" track.

I'm still trying to decide which tracks may be more interesting to me, but so far it looks like I'll be crossing between:

* Architecture 
* Developer Tools and Technologies 
* Mobility 
* Web Development and Infrastructure 
* Windows Client

Now I just have to wait until the sessions are published and then the real fun begins.
