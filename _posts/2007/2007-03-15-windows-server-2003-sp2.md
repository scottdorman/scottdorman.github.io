This service pack was just released amid a deafening roar of silence. Honestly, the service pack was released on schedule, but with very little fanfare. The service pack is available in both [32-bit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=95ac1610-c232-4644-b828-c55eec605d55&DisplayLang=en) and [64-bit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=08FEC2F5-6E3B-4E0D-9314-646414D0A421&displaylang=en) versions.

The service pack adds the improved Microsoft Management Console (MMC) 3.0 as well as many other fixes.
