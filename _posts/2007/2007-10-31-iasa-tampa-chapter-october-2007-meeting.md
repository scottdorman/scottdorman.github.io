Earlier this month, I [talked]({% post_url /2007/2007-10-10-international-association-of-software-architects-iasa-tampa-bay-chapter %}) about the inaugural meeting for the International Association of Software Architects ([IASA](http://www.iasahome.org/web/home/home)) Tampa Chapter, which was held last night (October 30th). We had about 20 people show up, mostly from the Tampa area. [Tom Fuller](http://soapitstop.com) kicked off the meeting by talking about the IASA and what the goals are for the Tampa Chapter. After that, [Jeff Barnes](http://blogs.msdn.com/jbarnes/) gave a [talk](http://www.dotnettikihut.com/downloads/Role_Of_Software_Architect_JBarnes.zip) on "The role of a Software Architect". 

I want to point out that even though this event was hosted by Microsoft and everyone who attended was a Microsoft-focused developer, the meetings and the IASA are not Microsoft centric. We would love to get architects from the rest of the developer community (i.e.., the non-Microsoft side) involved in these meetings as well.

If you are an experienced architect or want to learn what it means to be an architect, this is the group you want to join.

The next meeting is tentatively scheduled for November 28 at 6:30 PM. There is a [Windows Live Events](http://cid-0009c10c40687a2c.events.live.com/default.aspx) page setup for the event. If you are on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), there is a Facebook [group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5630314139) and [event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=6069174012&ref=mf) setup as well. Once it gets closer to the event we will probably also setup a Microsoft Events Click to Attend registration page as well. Please let us know which registration method you prefer. We are looking for speakers and/or topics for this meeting, so if you are interested let myself or Tom know.
