Just last night I received a private email asking for the install of my [XFN™ Live Writer Plugin]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-10-xfn-live-writer-plugin-updates %}) from Alexander Groß in Germany. After exchanging some emails to get him the installer, I was able to look at the Live Writer [plugin](http://www.it99.org/axl/2007/01/31/Now+Playing+20+Plugin+For+Windows+Live+Writer.aspx) he created for Windows Live Writer.

I am probably in the minority here, since I don't usually listen to music on my computer while I'm doing anything, but for those of you who do, this is a great plugin. 

This is version 2.0, and has been completely rewritten from his earlier release. The cool thing about this plugin is that it has plugins as well for the different music players and music databases available.

As you can see from the screen shot, you are able to pick a single media player plugin and multiple song information plugins.

Right out of the box, it supports [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) and [Windows Media Player](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.mspx). It also supports Amazon Album Lookup and [Music-Map](http://www.music-map.de/) (a German based site).

You also have the ability to customize the HTML markup that is inserted at the bottom of each post by providing a template. It also shows you a live preview of how the markup will be displayed.

The variables that are available to the template change based on the plugins that are enabled.

As I said earlier, this plugin is extensible by adding your own plugins for other music services and, I believe, other media players. You can download the [plugin](http://www.it99.org/axl/ct.ashx?id=9fe88d53-d57d-4ff7-8649-ea15df875d4a&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.it99.org%2faxl%2fdownload%2fNowPlaying-2.0.zip) and the [source code](http://www.it99.org/axl/ct.ashx?id=9fe88d53-d57d-4ff7-8649-ea15df875d4a&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.it99.org%2faxl%2fdownload%2fNowPlaying-2.0-Source.zip) from Alex's blog.

This plugin has also been submitted to the Windows Live Gallery, but is still waiting for approval just like mine. Hopefully it won't be too long before we see both of these plugins available there.
