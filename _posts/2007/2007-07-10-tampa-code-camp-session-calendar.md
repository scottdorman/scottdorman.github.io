In keeping with the work I did for Tech·Ed 2007 to create [Internet Calendars]({% post_url /2007/2007-05-10-outlook-2007-internet-calendar-subscriptions %}) for the different technical tracks, I have created a similar calendar for Tampa Code Camp. The calendar is available from Microsoft Office Online as an [Outlook 2007 Internet Calendar Subscription](webcals://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/q40rvv4z74713/Tampa_Code_Camp_Calendar.ics). If you are still using Outlook 2003, there is an [open-source add-in](http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotecalendars) that allows you to work with Internet Calendars.
