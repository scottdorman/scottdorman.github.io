One of the new technologies being announced at Tech·Ed is "[Acropolis](http://windowsclient.net/acropolis/)". If you have previously used the Microsoft Composite UI Application B lock (CAB) or the Smart Client Software Factory (SCSF), the announcement of the Acropolis should be very exciting news.

Acropolis is a replacement technology for both CAB and SCSF and takes the things that were good about both of these and the lessons learned and adds the following:

*   Full .NET support by being an integrated part of the .NET client framework and will be a fully supported product.
*   Full support for a WPF front end, including support for features such as transitions, themes, and view switching.
*   Full design time support in Visual Studio.
