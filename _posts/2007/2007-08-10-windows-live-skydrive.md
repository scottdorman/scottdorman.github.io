A while ago, I blogged about [Windows Live Folders]({% post_url /2007/2007-06-28-closed-betas-for-windows-live-folder-and-windows-live-photo-gallery %}) being in a closed beta. Yesterday, they just announced a name change to [Windows Live SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/) and their first public beta. According the the SkyDrive [team](http://skydriveteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns%21977F793E846B3C96%21124.entry), this beta has:

*   **An upgraded look and feel** — new graphics to go along with the new features!  
*   **"Also on SkyDrive"** — easily get back to the SkyDrives you've recently visited  
*   **Thumbnail images** — now you can see thumbnails of your image files  
*   **Drag and drop your files** — Drag and drop your files right onto your SkyDrive  
*   **Embed your stuff anywhere** — with just a few clicks, post your files and folders anywhere you can post html  

The only thing I'm not sure about is the new name...I think Windows Live Folders was clearer about the purpose of the product.
