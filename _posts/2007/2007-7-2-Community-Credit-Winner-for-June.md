![](http://www.community-credit.com/images/prizes/green-laser-pointer2_large.jpg)I am pleased to announce that I just won 4th place for the June 2007 Community Credit competition. This is 4th place out of a total of 7214 members.

The even more amazing thing, at least to me, is that I managed to win 4th place with an 85% curve on my points as part of the handicapping system. The worst is that now I have an even higher handicap to beat.

So, what did I win? An awesome green laser pointer, which is about 50 times brighter than a red laser pointer. It uses Diode Pumped Solid State Frequency Doubled (DPSSFD) laser technology. A high power IR laser diode at 808 nm pumps a tiny block of Nd:YVO4 generating light at 1,064 nm which feeds a KTP intracavity frequency doubler crystal to produce the green beam at 532 nm. What does all that mean? Unlike a red laser, the green beam itself can be seen in mid-air in dark conditions, not just the laser beam dot. This allows the green laser pointer to be used for pointing to star constellations (skypointing) and also just generally look cool as hell. The green laser beam dot can be seen at much greater distances than with a red laser pointer.
