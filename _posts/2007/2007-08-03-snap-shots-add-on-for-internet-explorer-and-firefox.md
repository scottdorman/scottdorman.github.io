I've blogged about Snap Shots in the past and think it's an excellent addition to any website. Now, you can have the power of Snap Shots **on** any website through the Snap Shots add-on for Internet Explorer or Firefox.

These add-ons bring the usefulness of Snap Shots to all websites, and takes everything you love about Snap Shots for your website and puts on the websites you visit every day.

Snap has profiled a large group of the most popular sites that you use every day, including Google, Yahoo!, MySpace, Amazon, Wikipedia, etc., so that all shots work on these sites. Here are Snap Shots on Yahoo! and Google:

For sites that aren't on the profile list, you can still get our enhanced shots: 

*   So, when you mouse over a video link **on any site**, you get an inline video. 
*   And when you want to check out a MySpace profile link **from any site**, you'll see who they are and what they look like. 
*   Scroll through a blogroll **on any blog** and you get RSS Shots of each of the RSS-enabled blogs. 
*   However, links to standard web content generally **will not** receive Snap Shots. 

Currently, Snap Shots Add-On is only available for Firefox (Mac and Windows) and Internet Explorer (Windows). A Safari version will be released soon.
