When Microsoft announced the Dynamic Language Runtime ([DLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Language_Runtime)) at MIX07, it was an interesting concept. Now, thanks to some very hard work by some of the talented people on the [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) project, it [only took 16 days](http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/05/monodlr_hello_dynamic_language.html) to get Microsoft's [IronPython](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironpython) running with DLR on Mono. This means that IronPython can now run:

*   In the Silverlight browser plugin  
*   Natively on Windows Vista  
*   On Windows XP with WinFx  
*   On Linux, BSD, and OSX with Mono 

It also means that the other dynamic languages (IronRuby, VBx, Smalltalk/DLR, etc.) should be portable as well.

This is excellent proof of the DLR concept and shows that it is truly viable. It also proves the stability and completeness of the Mono project.

Excellent job!
