[Tampa Code Camp](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/Default.aspx) for 2007 has just been announced. Registration just opened on June 4, 2007 so there is still plenty of room, but there is a maximum attendance of 400 people so space will fill up quickly.

This year, the event has moved to the [St. Petersburg College](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/Location.aspx) (ICOT Center) in Largo, Florida and will be held on July 14, 2007. The new location promises larger rooms and state of the art AV equipment.

If you have never attended Code Camp or don't know what it is, Code Camp is a **free** one day event similar to Tech·Ed but it is community driven. Speakers will be presenting on topics such as ASP.NET AJAX, Visual Studio 2008 (Orcas), Silverlight, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Sharepoint 2007, and SQL Server 2005.

I will be attending this year and hopefully will be presenting a Chalk Talk titled "Coding with Style" (thanks for the catchier title [AJ](http://geekswithblogs.net/AJWarnock/archives.aspx)), which will be similar to the Birds of a Feather session I just moderated at Tech·Ed 2007.
