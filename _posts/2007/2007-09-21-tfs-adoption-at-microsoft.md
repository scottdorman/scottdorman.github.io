Brian Harry just released new [statistics](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2007/09/15/update-on-microsoft-tfs-adoption.aspx) on Microsoft's internal adoption of TFS as they passed some fairly major milestones this month. Apparently, the adoption continues to grow at a fairly rapid pace, and there are now 1,160 Team Projects in production with 1,023,088 work items across all of the TFS instances.

Not only has the Developer Division adopted TFS, but also the Office and Windows divisions. Both Office and Windows have adopted early Rosario builds and are working through some installation issues with the Team Explorer client. The Developer Division should be completely switched over to TFS by the end of the year.

There are a total of 24 TFS servers in production:

*   3 running an early Rosario build
*   17 running TFS 2008 Beta 2
*   4 running TFS 2005 SP1 (which will soon be upgraded to TFS 2008 B2) 

Here are some nice graphs from Brian's post showing some of the overall trends:
