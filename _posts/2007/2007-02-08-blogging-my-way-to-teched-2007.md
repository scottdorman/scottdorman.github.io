{% include post/image.html image-file="o-little-guy-55-x-55-no-sh.gif" alt="" %}I tried to do this for last years TechEd, but wasn't as successful as I would have liked. This was mostly due to the fact that I didn't really know I was going until last minute. Anyway, this year should be different.

I have registered this blog in [TechEd Bloggers,](http://techedbloggers.net/) so wherever you see the "Blogger Guy" on any website, you should be able to go directly to the TechEd Bloggers site.
