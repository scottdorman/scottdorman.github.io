title: Refactor or Rewrite?

There was a recent [discussion](http://www.codeproject.com/lounge.asp?msg=2151482&mode=all&userid=36803#xx2151482xx) on [The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/ "The Code Project - Free Source Code and Tutorials") about the virtues of refactoring. This rather quickly turned in to a question about what the difference is between refactoring and rewriting code. I have worked for a manager who loved to say "I'm confident in my ability to refactor" whenever we would talk about making sure the initial design was solid.

So, what **is** the difference? I think John Simmons provided the best [definition](http://www.codeproject.com/lounge.asp?mode=all&userid=36803&select=2151723&df=100&forumid=1159&fr=1103.5#xx2151723xx). Rewriting implies that you are throwing away all (or most) of the existing code while refactoring implies that you're moving around the existing code and redesigning small parts of it.

I think the distinction between them is important, particularly in cases like I mentioned above. In that case, the "refactoring" that was being referred to was essentially rewriting the code each time because it wasn't designed properly in the first place.
