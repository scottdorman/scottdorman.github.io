I know I just [mentioned]({% post_url /2007/2007-12-23-msbuildcontrib-project-on-codeplex %}) this project yesterday, but I wanted to thank those of you who have already downloaded it. Hopefully you have found it useful so far. I have already updated the project for the 1.0.2913.51352 release, which adds a few new tasks and cleans up some of the existing ones.

Here is the current list of tasks:

|**NAnt/NAntContrib Task**|**MSBuildContrib Task**|**Status**|**Description**|
|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------------|
|attrib                   |Attrib                 |Complete\*|Changes the file attributes of a file or set of files and directories.|
