I have finally switched over to using "friendly names" for my blog posts. I think I was the last hold-out among the Subtext developers. One of the statistics that Site Meter provides is the ability to show entry and exit pages. This is great, except for the fact that all of my posts up until now had a numeric name, so it made it very difficult to see what the post was. None of the old posts will be renamed, but the new ones will have a friendly name based on the post title.
