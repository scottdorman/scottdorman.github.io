The first CTP of the [Microsoft Sync Framework]( http://msdn.microsoft.com/sync) was announced during the keynote at Microsoft TechEd Developers 2007 in Barcelona. The Microsoft Sync Framework is a comprehensive synchronization platform enabling collaboration and offline for applications, services and devices with support for any data type, any data store, any transfer protocol, and network topology. 

Building on the synchronization functionality that is already available in Visual Studio 2008, the Sync Framework will allow developers to add offline synchronization capabilities to their applications using a rich designer experience.
