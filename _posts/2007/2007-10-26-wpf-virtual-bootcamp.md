I just came across a post by [Tim Sneath](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/10/26/attend-the-wpf-virtual-bootcamp-no-need-to-register.aspx) announcing the WPF Virtual Bootcamp. This is a three-day virtual training course that covers all aspects of WPF as part of MIX University. The best part about this bootcamp is that it's completely free. This was originally delivered on the Redmond campus earlier this year to a small invited audience and features:

*   A keynote from [Ian Ellison-Taylor](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=284474), the general manager responsible for WPF, Silverlight and client platform tools.
*   Introductory sessions on core WPF topics from [Ian Griffiths](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/) and others.
*   In-depth training by talented and knowledgeable speakers from the product group such as [Beatriz Costa](http://www.beacosta.com/blog/) and [Kevin Moore](http://work.j832.com/).
*   Five sessions on real-world experiences from early adopters who built applications ranging from [The North Face kiosk application](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=116327) to the [new Yahoo Messenger client](http://messenger.yahoo.com/windowsvista.php). 
*   Nine self-paced hands-on labs you can use as a starting point for your own experimentation and further learning. 

Of course, you will need [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/#4_0) installed in order to watch the videos. If you go through the bootcamp, be sure to let Microsoft know what you liked and didn't like about it as they are planning on doing another one next year that will be updated to include further content around Visual Studio 2008 and Expression Blend 2.0.
