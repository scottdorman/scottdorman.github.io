With the release of the Virtual Earth 6 API, there is a new [Interactive SDK](http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk/) that goes along with it. If you haven't seen the Interactive SDK, it's a great way to learn the VE API using a "show and tell" model. The SDK shows a list of the more commonly used features (and some of the more advanced features, like importing data into shape layers or using custom tile layers), lets you see how it looks and then view the source code required to implement that feature.

The entire Virtual Earth SDK is a Javascript object model and is extremely powerful and [well documented](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905677.aspx) on MSDN. The other nice thing is that previous versions of Virtual Earth are still available as well.
