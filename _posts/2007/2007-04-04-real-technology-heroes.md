![](/img/posts/{% page.id %}/o_RTHLogo2.png)In an excellent tribute to the Budweiser "Real Men of Genius" commercials comes [Real Technology Heroes](http://www.realtechnologyheroes.com).  Just like the original Bud commercials, this site salutes those geeks that don't get recognized...but **should**.

That's right, we salute **you**, Mr. "[select * from table examples](http://www.realtechnologyheroes.com/audio/RTH_SelectStarFromTableExampleGuy_01_DavidSilverlight.mp3)" guy and **you** Mr. "[I can write my own version of .NET faster than Microsoft](http://www.realtechnologyheroes.com/audio/RTH_BuildYourOwnASPNETGuy_01_DavidSilverlight.mp3)" guy, and all of the others that deserve recognition.

**Stand up and be recognized!**

Submit your own Real Technology Hero and be eligible for the monthly competition. Each month, two winners are selected: one for the person who suggested a new hero and one for the person who wrote the lyrics for the best new hero. The winners receive a coffee mug and T-shirt with their hero on it.

The site is relatively new, but it promises some excellent new heroes. Submit yours today!
