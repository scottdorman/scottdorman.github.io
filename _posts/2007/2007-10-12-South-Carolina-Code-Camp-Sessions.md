If you're going to the [South Carolina Code Camp 2007](http://www.sccodecamp.com/), be sure to check out my sessions. I'm giving two talks:

*   Code Styles and Standards (Chalk Talk), 8:30 AM - 9:40 AM 
*   Garbage Collection in .NET, 11:10 AM - 12:20 PM 

If you make it and go to my sessions (or even if you don't), the presentations are available for download on [Windows Live SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/) in the [South Carolina Code Camp](http://cid-93d618d639ec9651.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/Code%20Camp/2007/South%20Carolina) folder.
