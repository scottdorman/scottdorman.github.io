[Microsoft SharedView](http://get.live.com/betas/sharedview_betas) is now in Beta 2. While SharedView isn't a Windows Live application, it is available under the [Windows Live Betas](http://get.live.com/betas/home2) page, and will probably end up being rebranded to Windows Live SharedView before it actually ships. Even though there is a similar application available to Windows Vista users (Windows Meeting Space), I have a feeling that both Microsoft SharedView and the [Windows Live Photo Gallery](http://get.live.com/betas/photogallery_betas) will eventually replace both Windows Meeting Space and Windows Photo Gallery, respectively.

Some of the key features of Microsoft SharedView are:

*   Hold more effective meetings and conference calls
*   *   Connect with up to 15 people in different locations and get your point across by showing them what's on your screen. Work together in real time
*   *   Share, review, and update documents with multiple people in real time. Use when and where you want
*   *   SharedView is easy to use, from anywhere, at a moment's notice. New in Beta 2!
*   *   Improved performance, sign-in and join experiences. Group chat has been added so you can to send messages to the other people in a session.
