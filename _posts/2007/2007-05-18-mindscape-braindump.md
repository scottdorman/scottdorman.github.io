My friend [Simone](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz/), from [Subtext](http://www.subtextproject.com/) and the creator of the [CCNET monitor gadget for Vista](http://codeclimber.net.nz/category/19.aspx), was just interviewed for the first Mindscape BrainDump video blog post. 

Check out the full video at: [BrainDump #1 - Simone Chiaretta](http://www.mindscape.co.nz/blog/?p=28).

Congratulations, Simone!
