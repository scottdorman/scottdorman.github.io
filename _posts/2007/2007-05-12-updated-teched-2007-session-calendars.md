The great folks at EventPoint (the company that coordinates TechÂ·Ed for Microsoft and is responsible for the Schedule Builder) have updated the RSS feed I was using to generate the Internet Calendars to include the rest of the sessions as well as some additional data that made my life much easier. (Thanks, Andy!)

I have updated the calendars, so if you downloaded these as a subscription it should have been automatically updated. If not, you can download them from the following links. I have also added a calendar specifically for the Instructor Led Labs. Hopefully, there won't be any other updates, but if there are I can update the calendars much more easily now.

**All sessions, by Track:**
