It seems I've gone a little Live Search crazy today and I have updated the Live Search box on my blog again. This is the last one, I promise.

I have added a new tab to search [The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) and made the search results panel a little bit wider in order to accommodate the additional tab. This new search tab will also be available on the [Windows Live Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/default.aspx?pl=4&bt=13) and is available **[online](http://search.live.com/macros/sjdorman/codeproject/?FORM=OIJG)** or by adding **macro:sjdorman.codeproject** to a query in any Live Search box.
