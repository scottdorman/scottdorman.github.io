One of the "staples" of the Tech·Ed experience has always been the [Virtual TechEd](http://www.virtualteched.com/) site. This year, Microsoft is changing things around a little bit and making the site live year round in order to extend the Tech·Ed experience before, during, and after the conference.

As part of the new experience, the site has undergone a major facelift, and the home page is broken down into 4 sections:

1.  News & Happenings
2.  Oline Sessions
3.  Tech·Ed RSS Feeds
4.  Other Resources 

As I was browsing the site, I noticed that I'm listed under the Tech·Ed RSS Feeds section. Be sure to check it out.
