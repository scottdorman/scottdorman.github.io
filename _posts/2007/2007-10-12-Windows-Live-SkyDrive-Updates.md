Along with Microsoft's recently introduced [Windows Live Events]({% post_url /2007/2007-10-12-Windows-Live-Events %}), a few minor updates were made to [Windows Live SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/) as well. The new features are an increase in the online storage space from 500MB to 1GB. In addition to more storage space, all public folders now have an RSS feed. To subscribe to a folders RSS feed, go to the public folder you're interested in and click the ![Feed16](http://gwb.blob.core.windows.net/sdorman/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsLiveSkyDriveUpdates_87BE/Feed16_6.gif)  icon at the top right of the page.

Now you can share with anyone directly from SkyDrive by typing the person's email address. 

Also new in the update is the ability to see who uploaded each file. This is really good for public folders and shared folders that have read and write access.

These new features are great to see and I'm confident they will help make SkyDrive even better than it currently is. (This is, after all, still a beta product.) I am looking forward to seeing what else the SkyDrive team will be adding. This latest update solves some of my desired features, but there are still a few that haven't been addressed yet:

1.  The ability to download multiple files at once through the same (or similar) mechanism as the file upload tool.  
2.  The ability to interact with my SkyDrive folders as if they were actual folders on the file system.  
3.  Additional storage space for those paying for a subscription to Windows Live Hotmail Plus.
