Well, I am now a 4-time Community Credit winner! I first won in [February]({% post_url /2007/2007-03-04-community-credit-february-prize-winner %}), and then again in [April]({% post_url /2007/2007-05-03-community-credit-winner-for-april %}) and [June]({% post_url /2007/2007-07-02-Community-Credit-Winner-for-June %}). ![](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/other/atari-joystick-closeup.jpg)

This time around, I took 7th place out of 7,395 members. The prize this time is pretty cool, as well...although not as cool as the laser pointer I won last time. It certainly brings back memories of simpler times, when game consoles first starting appearing in the consumer market. Of course, I'm talking about Atari and Pong.

The most amazing thing about these key chains is that they contain actual real Atari games. They come with a 6 foot cable and can be plugged in to a television set to play your choice of: Asteroids, Millipede, Centipede, Yar's Revenge, or Pong.

How cool is it to have your very own completely portable Atari game system that literally fits in the palm of your hand?
