The Keynote speaker for TechÂ·Ed 2007 will be Bug Muglia, Senior Vice President of the Microsoft Server and Tools business. The Keynote will cover the evolution of IT from an organizational cost center (a group that is expected to cost a company money each year rather than earning revenue) to a strategic asset (one that is expected to earn revenue). He will also cover how to help your IT department embrace this new role and fuel growth and innovation.

The Server and Tools business is responsible for developing Microsoft's infrastructure and developer software and solutions. This includes Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, the System Center products, and the Forefront products. Also included in this group is Microsoft Managed Services.
