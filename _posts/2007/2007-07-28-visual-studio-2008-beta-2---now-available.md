Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 has been officially [released](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx) as both disc images and Virtual PC (VPC) images.  After the installation has finished, you should run this [script](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=95792) to ensure that the installation of .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 will not affect the development of ASP.NET AJAX 1.0 applications. 

To go along with this, the [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7171923) is also available and includes a go-live license. The Framework is expected to be released near the end of 2007. It will be included in Visual Studio 2008 and will also continue to be available for separate download on MSDN. You can also download the [Visual Studio 2008 Express Editions](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/future/bb421473.aspx).

Scott Guthrie has an excellent [post](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/26/vs-2008-and-net-3-5-beta-2-released.aspx) providing a summary of several of the new features available. 

If you want an easier way to download the files, check out the [Microsoft Secure Content Downloader](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9a927cf6-16e4-4e21-9608-77f06d2156bb) from Microsoft Research. 

> The Microsoft Secure Content Downloader (MSCD) is a peer-assisted download manager capable of securely downloading specific files. MSCD is intended for consumers who are downloading from a home PC, or business users whose computers are not behind a corporate firewall. If you use MSCD from behind a corporate firewall, you may be unable to download content, and may adversely affect other clients' ability to download content.

This is a Community Technology Preview (CTP) release and will expire on August 22, 2007. The interesting thing is that this is basically a torrent client.
