Even though [Phil](http://haacked.com) just recently started working at [Koders.com](http://koders.com) and even more recently became a [Microsoft MVP](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/01/bank-error-in-my-favor.-im-a-microsoft-mvp.aspx), he's leaving Koders to move (eventually) a bit farther north and is [joining](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx) Microsoft to work with [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) on the new MVC framework for ASP.NET. He starts at Microsoft on October 15. 

Best luck, Phil. I expect to see some really great things in the new framework. I'm just a bit envious, too. :)
