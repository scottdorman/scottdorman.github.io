Up until now, Windows Live Writer has not had a good product page to reference. Anyone who wanted to linked their blog posts either to [the Writer Team Blog](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) or directly the Writer MSI.

That has all changed!

Now you can also directly navigate to the Writer product page directly at: [http://writer.live.com/](http://writer.live.com/).  It features links to [the Writer Team Blog](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) and the [Writer feedback forum](http://groups.msn.com/windowslivewriter/home).

Now we just have to wait for an updated release.
