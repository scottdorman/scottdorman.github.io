The Tampa Bay chapter of the International Association of Software Architects ([IASA](http://www.iasahome.org/web/home/home)) is dedicated to building a community of professionals interested in topics related to software architecture.  This organization welcomes all interested professionals.  Whether you are a senior enterprise architect at a fortune 100 company or an aspiring architect with only a few years of experience.

The next meeting will be Wednesday, November 28 from 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM at the Microsoft offices in Tampa. The speaker is Cory Foy, an agile developer passionate about languages such as C# and Ruby. He currently works for Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer, has been a developer on the NUnit team, and is known to speak at code camps and user groups across the country. He maintains an agile blog at [http://www.cornetdesign.com](http://www.cornetdesign.com).

The topic of the meeting will be working effectively with legacy code. Here is the meeting abstract:

> You can run, you can switch jobs, and you can write unit tests, but invariably at some point you will run into legacy code. Legacy code hides in many forms - sealed classes, spaghetti and big-ball-of-mud code, data in disparate data sources (or incompatible schemas). As an architect, there are steps you can take to get ahead of these issues and begin to make your codebases something you actually want to change.
> 
> In this talk, we will discuss concepts from Michael Feathers' work on Working Effectively with Legacy Code as well as Scott Ambler's work on refactoring databases. You'll see tips and tricks to model your legacy code and data, and hear about ways to begin to turn your legacy code into a usable base.
