![MySpace China Logo](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/NihaoMySpaceChinaHowisSubtextWorkingOutF_6BA/logo_3.png)[Phil](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/29/subtext-powers-myspace-china-blogs.aspx) and [Steve](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/10/29/myspace-china-blogs-are-now-subtexting.aspx) beat me to announcing, but Phil has officially confirmed that [MySpace China](http://myspace.cn/ "MySpace China") is using a modified version of [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com) for it's blogging engine.

This is incredible news as MySpace China gets around 100 million page views, of which about 1 million go to the blog. What does that mean? Well, for starters it means that Subtext is definitely a scalable and robust blogging engine. It also means that Subtext and it's skinning capabilities can support double-byte Kanji based character sets with apparent ease.

According to Phil, there were a few bugs that the MySpace China developers needed to fix that were only found when Subtext was put under such an extreme load. Hopefully they will contribute those fixes as [patches](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=137896&atid=739981), even though they aren't required to do so under [our license](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/About/License/tabid/110/Default.aspx). It would be great to get these patches into the main Subtext builds, which will make the engine even more powerful.

This is a huge accomplishment by a great group of developers and will (I hope) certainly mean much bigger things for Subtext in the future. Great job guys!
