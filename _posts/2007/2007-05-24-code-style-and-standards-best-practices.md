For those of you who are attending TechÂ·Ed 2007, be sure to check out my Birds of a Feather session (BOF11) on Code Style and Standards. The session is scheduled for Tuesday, June 5, 2007 at 1:00 PM in Room S331 A.

As a teaser to get you to attend, we are going to discuss what code style and standards actually mean and why they are important to you as a developer but also to your company. Yes, we will cover some of the "holy wars" regarding "curly brace placement" and "tab size", but also things like white-space and indenting, comments, and spelling.

Join us for a fun and lively 75 minute discussion on what works and doesn't work when it comes to code style and standards.
