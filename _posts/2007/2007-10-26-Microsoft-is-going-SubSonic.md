Short on the heels of [Phil]({% post_url 2007-09-21-Phil-Haack-moving-to-Microsoft %}) moving to Microsoft to work on the new [ASP.NET MVC Framework](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/14/asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Framework") is the announcement that [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/26/microsoft-subsonic-and-me/), the creator of [SubSonic](http://subsonicproject.com/ "SubSonic"), is also moving to Microsoft. Rob will be building out SubSonic to sit on top of ASP.NET and the new MFV Framework. So, as Rob puts it, "SubSonic will be the convention-driven toolset for Microsoft's new MVC framework."

Fortunately for all of us, SubSonic hasn't been bought and will remain open source under the MPL 1.1 license it currently has.

This move certainly seems to help legitimize Microsoft's move to accepting Open Source, and it will provide an excellent data layer to sit on top of the MVC framework.

My only question is if Rob will have to move to Redmond?
