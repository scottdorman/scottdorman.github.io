One of the topic areas that I am focusing on at Tech·Ed this year is Smart Clients. In keeping with my [other]({% post_url 2007/2007-05-15-Added-Management-and-Operations-Track-Calendar %}) Internet Calendars, I have created a calendar for all of the Smart Client related sessions. It is available at:
