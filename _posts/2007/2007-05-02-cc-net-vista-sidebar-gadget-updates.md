For those of you who are keeping up with the progress [Simone Chiaretta](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz) has been making on his excellent CC.NET Monitor gadget, he is getting ready to release the 0.8 version. This version includes a lot of feedback received, and implements the following features:
 <li>new tab style settings page  </li><li>ability to monitor more than one CC.NET dashboard  </li><li>possibility to choose which project to display for each server  </li><li>added a license page (which is the [new BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), as stated in [my copyright and licensing policy](http://codeclimber.net.nz/articles/CodeClimber-Copyright-and-Licensing-Policy.aspx))  </li><li>added an icon at the bottom of both docked and undocked view with a global status: it's green if all the projects are building correctly, it's red if at least one of them is failing  </li><li>removed the strings with the current activity and replaced the sleeping text with that icon: ![](http://codeclimber.net.nz/images/codeclimber_net_nz/WindowsLiveWriter/CC.NETMonitorforVistavNext_130BD/idle%5B6%5D.png)</li>

Now that I see the "sleeping" icon, I like the combination of status and activity using just icons and will actually be incorporating this into the Subtext dashboard shortly. This gadget is quickly becoming a very viable replacement for the CCTray application on Vista. I know Simone is planning to add the ability to force a build in an upcoming release.
