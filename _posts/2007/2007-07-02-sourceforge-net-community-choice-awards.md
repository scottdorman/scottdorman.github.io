Thank you to everyone who nominated Subtext for a Community Choice Award.

Your nominations have made Subtext a finalist in the following categories:

**Most Collaborative Project**: The project most likely to accept your patches and value your input.

**Best Project for Communications**: The best project for talking to your friends or sharing information.

I think both of these categories very accurately reflect what Subtext is all about. It's great to see that the community feels the same.

Voting has already started and runs until July 26th. Winners will be announced July 30th.
