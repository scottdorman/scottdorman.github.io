As I was building the [Internet Calendar]({% post_url 2007-07-10-Tampa-Code-Camp-Session-Calendar %}) for Tampa Code Camp, I realized that I have the dubious distinction of being the only Chalk Talk session. I am a little bit surprised since this format (which is very similar to the Birds of a Feather session format from Tech·Ed) provides a good round-table interactive discussion on the topic.

If you are going to [Tampa Code Camp](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/), be sure to check out my session on Code Style and Standards. The session is scheduled at 10:50 AM in Room 451.

As a teaser to get you to attend, we are going to discuss what code style and standards actually mean and why they are important to you as a developer but also to your company. Yes, we will cover some of the "holy wars" regarding "curly brace placement" and "tab size", but also things like white-space and indenting, comments, and spelling. 

Join us for a fun and lively 60 minute discussion on what works and doesn't work when it comes to code style and standards.
