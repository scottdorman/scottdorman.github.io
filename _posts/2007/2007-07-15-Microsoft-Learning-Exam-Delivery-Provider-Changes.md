Pearson VUE will no longer be selling exams after August 31, 2007. For anyone who purchases an exam from Pearson VUE through August 31, Pearson will be able to administer that exam through December 31, 2007.

More details are promised in the upcoming months, but for now there is a [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcpexams/register/edp/faq/default.mspx "http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcpexams/register/edp/faq/default.mspx") page.
