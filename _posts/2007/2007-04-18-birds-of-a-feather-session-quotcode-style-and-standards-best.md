I just received notification from INETA that my Birds-of-a-Feather session, "Code Style and Standards - Best Practices" has been accepted for TechEd 2007. The session is currently scheduled for Tuesday, June 5 at 1:00 PM. I want to thank everyone that voted for my session, I greatly appreciate it and hope to see you there.

Just to get everyone thinking a little bit about the topic, discussions aboutÂ code style and standards usually end up in very heated debates and end up in a stale-mate at best or one or more "factions" being disappointed with a compromise. Despite the high volatility of the subject, everyone has an opinion about at least one aspect of code style or standards. This session will try to provide a definition of what code style and standards are, why they are important, and an open discussion of what has worked and what hasn't worked for you when it comes time to implement them. Hopefully along the way we'll discover some best practices and some creative ways to make introducing and implementing standards a little easier.
