TechÂ·Ed is well known for the Birds-of-a-Feather, or BOF, sessions. These sessions let you meet people with similar interests and challenges in an open-forum environment. BOFs are organized by [INETA](http://www.ineta.org), the developer user group and [Culminis](http://www.culminis.org), the IT pro user group.

Because these sessions are led by third-party experts, attendees enjoy free-flowing dialogues about products, technologies, and solutions without necessarily focusing on Microsoft. The sessions are suggested by the developer and IT pro community and voted on by the community.

I decided this year to submit a BOF topic. I won't know until the end of March if my topic was accepted, but I thought I would submit one anyway.

The topic I chose is titled "Code Styles and Standards - Best Practices?". The idea for this session is to talk about code standards and style guidelines, which can usually be a very volatile topic. I am hoping that by getting a group of relative strangers together we can talk about what our experiences have been with code standards and styles, what worked, what didn't, and why having them is a good idea. Along the way, maybe we'll discover some "best practices" and some creative ways to make introducing standards at your company a little bit easier.
