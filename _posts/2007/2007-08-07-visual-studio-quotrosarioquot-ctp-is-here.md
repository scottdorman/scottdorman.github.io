I blogged a few days ago about the upcoming release of the August CTP for [Visual Studio "Rosario"](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/bb725993.aspx). It seems I was just a day too soon. The CTP was released on Saturday as a Virtual PC (VPC) [image](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=8450EFF5-24AD-44C3-AB91-1ED88EF2F4F0&displaylang=en).

The majority of new features that are part of the CTP are centered around improvements in Team System, most notably in the areas of quality and testing. From [Brian Harry](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/)'s blog, 

> This CTP delivers a mix of features supporting both scenarios - including an update MSF CMMI template, user definable links types, hierarchical work items, work item queries on links, an awesome manual testing tool and more.

Since I don't need any of the features in this CTP,Â I'm going to stick with Visual Studio 2008. The next CTP should be out in about 3 months; when that happens I'll take another look at it.
