There are 14 core tracks and 2 virtual tracks at Tech·Ed this year, which will cover more than 1,000 sessions. In case you're wondering, a virtual track is a collection of sessions or labs that share a common theme but span several tracks.

The Session Scheduler launches in April and we will get our first real look at the actual sessions available in each track. Until then, we have to be content to speculate.

Looking at the [technical tracks](http://www.msteched.com/public/tracks.aspx) page, it became clear to me that there is a lot of information on this page, but it doesn't present the key products and technologies covered by each track in an easy to find manner. Here is a bulleted summary to make it a little easier.
