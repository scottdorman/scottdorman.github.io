This visual icon has been missing since Windows CardSpace was introduced.

It is important to note that this is not a Windows CardSpace icon.

You are free to use this icon (following the usage guidelines) to provide a clear, consistent visual cue to your users that your sites and applications support Information Cards. Make sure toÂ [download the Information Card Icon package](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ce99e033-39a8-4bc5-9014-60ed0b560d0e&displaylang=en) which contains usage guidelines, FAQ, and a series of pre-rendered PNG images in different sizes along with the master Illustrator artwork.
