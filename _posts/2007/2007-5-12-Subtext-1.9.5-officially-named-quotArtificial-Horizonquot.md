As I mentioned [earlier,](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/05/12/112436.aspx) Subtext 1.9.5 was officially released yesterday without mention of a [codename](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/02/07/Codename-your-releases.aspx). The missing codename was an oversight, as it is officially named "Artificial Horizon".

For those of you keeping track, all of the Subtext code names follow a nautical theme, usually one that sounds cool and has some relation to the features in that release. The current list of releases is:

*   1.0 - Nautilus
*   1.5 - Nautilus R & R
*   1.9 - Daedelus
*   1.9.2 - Shields Up
*   1.9.3 - Repair Job
*   1.9.4 - Windward
*   1.9.5 - Artificial Horizon 

When 2.0 ships it will be "Poseidon", and 2.1 will be "Red October".
