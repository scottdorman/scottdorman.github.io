![](/img/posts{{ page.path | remove: '_posts' | remove: '.md' }}/o_Little-Guy---55-x-55--no-sh.gif)I tried to do this for last years Tech·Ed, but wasn't as successful as I would have liked. This was mostly due to the fact that I didn't really know I was going until last minute. Anyway, this year should be different.

I have registered this blog in [Tech·Ed Bloggers,](http://techedbloggers.net/) so wherever you see the "Blogger Guy" on any website, you should be able to go directly to the Tech·Ed Bloggers site.
