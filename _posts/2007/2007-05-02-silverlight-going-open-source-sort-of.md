Last month, I blogged about [Adobe Flex going open source]({% post_url /2007/2007-04-27-adobe-flex-going-open-source %}). It seems Microsoft has taken notice, and is making **some** of Silverlight available as open source. Microsoft is also releasing the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) and IronPython on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) under the Microsoft Permissive License. This allows developers and users to view, modify and redistribute source code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes, and also to charge a license fee for any code they've added to the software.

A DLR based version of Ruby, called IronRuby, is also in the works and will be included in a future release of Silverlight.
