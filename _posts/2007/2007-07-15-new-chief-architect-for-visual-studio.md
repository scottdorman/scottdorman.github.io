While it probably won't have much real impact of Visual Studio 2008, [Rico Marianai](http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2007/07/12/news-about-me.aspx) just recently announced that he is moving into the role of Chief Architect for Visual Studio. A lot of the performance improvements in VS 2008 are a result of Rico's involvement. It will be interesting to see how this impacts the next release.
