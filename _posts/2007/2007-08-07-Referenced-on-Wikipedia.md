I periodically look at my blog statistics, more out of idle curiosity than anything else. As part of that, I look at the referrers to the various blog posts. Today, as I was browsing my referrer list, I noticed that one of the referrers was [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org). Intrigued, I took a look at the [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asp.net), and my blog [post]({% post_url 2007/2007-07-10-Visual-Studio-2008-release-date %}) about the Visual Studio 2008 launch date was listed as a reference.
