[Clark Sells](http://blogs.msdn.com/csell/archive/2007/09/21/the-vsts-resources-map.aspx), whom I believe is part of the VSTS team, has created an excellent "mind map" around all of the VSTS resources available online. This map shows bloggers, tools, MSDN references, and other community pages. Along with the VSTS Resources map, he has also created a [map](http://blogs.msdn.com/csell/archive/2007/09/21/microsoft-teamfoundation-build-targets-2005.aspx) that shows the target stack for the TeamBuild targets.

If you do anything with VSTS, these are excellent resources.
