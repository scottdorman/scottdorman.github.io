title: IASA Tampa Chapter - January 2008 Meeting
date: '2007-12-20 10:25:08 -05:00'

As I mentioned in my last [post]({% post_url /2007/2007-12-19-iasa-tampa-chapter-updates %}), we aren't holding a December meeting. Instead, the next meeting will be Thursday, January 31 from 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM at the Microsoft offices in Tampa. This is the same night as the [Free Day of Patterns and Practices Tampa 2008 Roadshow]({% post_url /2007/2007-12-19-free-day-of-patterns-and-practices-tampa-2008-roadshow %}), so if you are attending the PnP day be sure to stick around for the IASA meeting afterwards.

The speaker is [Ron Jacobs](http://www.ronjacobs.com/), an Architect Evangelist in the [Microsoft Architecture Strategy group](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture) based at the company headquarters in Redmond Washington. Since 1999 Ron has been a product and program manager on various Microsoft products including the .Net Framework, Windows Communication Foundation and COM+. A top-rated conference speaker, author and host of the podcast show [ARCast.TV](http://www.arcast.tv), Ron brings over 20 years of industry experience to his role of helping Microsoft customers and partners to build architecturally sound and secure applications.

Look for an update as soon as we finalize the topic.
