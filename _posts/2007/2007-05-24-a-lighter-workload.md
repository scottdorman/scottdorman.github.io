Today will probably be my last day of blogging for about a week while I am on vacation. I'll actually be on a cruise ship in Alaska so I won't have much (if any) internet or even cell phone access. I do get some free minutes on the ship's internet cafe, but it won't be enough for any serious work...and I can't hook my laptop up, at least without paying $0.50US per minute for access.

After the cruise I will be at TechÂ·Ed 2007, so expect to see a lot of posts coming from that. See you there!
