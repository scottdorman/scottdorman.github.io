[Joost](http://www.joost.com/) is a new way of watching TV on the internet. With Joost, you get all the things you love about TV, including a high-quality full-screen picture, hundreds of full-length shows and easy channel-flipping.

You get great internet features too, such as search, chat and instant messaging, built right into the program - so you find shows quickly and talk to your friends while you watch. And with no schedules to worry about, you can watch whatever you want, whenever you like - as often as you want. Joost is completely free, and works with most modern PCs and Intel Mac-based computers with a broadband connection.

Joost started in 2006 under the code name of The Venice Project. More than a year of very hard work later, their vision is ready for public viewing. 

In that time, Joost has grown from a handful of people in a small office outside Amsterdam to more than 100 people spread right across Europe and North America. Joost is already a global venture, bringing TV to a global, highly networked community. And already, it's setting new standards for 21st-century entertainment.

Even though this is a relatively new company, they have some major corporate backing and exclusive deals. CBS Corporation and Viacom are both investors and also content partners, providing channels and programming on Joost. CBS has contributed more than 2000 hours of CBS entertainment, sports and news programming, including the full CSI franchise, SURVIVOR, NCIS, NUMB3RS, FAT ACTRESS, THE CBS EVENING NEWS WITH KATIE COURIC, FACE THE NATION, clips form THE EARLY SHOW, 48 HOURS, CBS SUNDAY MORNING,  COLLEGE FOOTBALL HIGHLIGHT SHOW, NFL TODAY HOT TOPIC, GAME OF THE WEEK, ONE2ONE and GO PRO OR GO HOME. 

Viacom is a "Key Launch Partner", providing channels and programming from across all of its properties including: Comedy Central, MTV, VH1 and Paramount Pictures. MTV will offer popular shows, both past and present, including Laguna Beach, Beavis & Butthead, Real World, Punk'd and My Super Sweet Sixteen, while COMEDY CENTRAL will feature episodes from Stella, CCP's and Freak Show. Also, Paramount Pictures will be providing full-length feature films from its catalog of classics and recent releases.

In addition, Joost has secured broadcasting from Turner Broadcasting System, Hasbro, the National Hockey League (NHL), Sports Illustrated (SI), Sony Pictures Television, and exclusive broadcasting with Warner Bros. Television Group.

It's not available outside of an ivitation only beta test program, but this promises to revolutionize the way we watch television.
