According to [APC](http://apcmag.com/5835/vendors_in_no_rush_to_ditch_xp_for_vista) magazine, Windows XP is due to be phased out by the end of 2007. Microsoft plans to stop OEM copies as an option for system builders. What this will mean is that starting next year, any new computer bought from a retailer **must** come with Windows Vista.

Dell has [indicated](http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/04/04/10397.aspx) that it continue offering Windows XP on select system until later this summer.

This is an interesting move by Microsoft, in that it will force Vista on the consumer market whether it is ready for it or not. On one hand, this is brilliant (although probably very gorilla) marketing since it is guaranteed to put Vista in the hands of a huge number of consumers. On the other hand, it can also be viewed as very pushy and is likely to upset, or at least annoy, a lot of consumers and businesses alike.
