I want to thank everyone who attended my Birds of a Feather session at TechÂ·Ed 2007. There were about 100 people that showed up and I think we had a good discussion on what code style and standards mean and why they are important.

What surprised me the most about the session was the amount of interest. As a result, I will be posting regular blog entries on this topic under the "Code Styles & Standards" category in my blog. I will also be reviewing the past code standards documents I have written and creating an updated document.

I am also planning on submitting this as a session topic for the upcoming Tampa Code Camp, so if you missed the Birds of a Feather session (or want to continue the discussion) and are able to go to the Code Camp, be sure to check it out.

If you have any specific questions or issues relating to code styles and standards, please get in touch with me through my blog.
