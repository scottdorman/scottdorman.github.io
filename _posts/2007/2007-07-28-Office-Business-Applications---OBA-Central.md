Up until now, if you were developing an Office Business Application (OBA) there weren't a lot of resources available. OBA Central means to change that. It is a community site that brings together Microsoft, Microsoft OBA ISVs, services partners and customers, making it easy to connect. There are already a few Microsoft Partners featured on the site.
