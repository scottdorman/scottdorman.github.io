It only took 14 years to decide to go after a Microsoft certification, but I decided it was probably time. My blog has been getting more and more visibility and those 4 little initials after your name add a lot of credibility in the industry.

The certification that made the most sense for me to start with was [Microsoft Certified Professional Developer: Windows Developer (MCPD: Windows Developer) certification](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/windev/default.mspx "http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/windev/default.mspx"). Just in case you aren't up on all of the different Microsoft certifications available, the MCPD: Windows Developer "certification demonstrates that you have the comprehensive skills that are required to build rich client applications that target the Windows Forms platform using the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0."

For me, the exams were a way to truly test my knowledge. I have never believed in cramming for an exam of any sort, particularly certification exams. Even though there were study materials, free practice exams, and MCTs available I made very little use of any of those resources. I have been a developer for 14 years and have been working with .NET since the first release of the .NET Framework, so if I can't pass an exam on what I already know there is a big problem.

Needless to say, I scored well over the 700 required to pass each exam and am now an official MCPD. From what the MCTs said, there are not many people that have earned an MCPD: Windows Development...most people go for the Web Development certification. In either case, I'm looking forward to receiving my MCP ID and Welcome Kit.
