Hopefully I'm not jumping the gun, but I was just given a tentative "green light" to be able to go to [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/teched) again this year. 

{% include post/image.html image-file="r-teched2007-banner.jpg" alt="" %} 

This year, the focus will be on all of the newly released products, such as Vista, Exchange Server 2007, Office 2007, andÂ ASP.NET AJAX. I'll see you there.
