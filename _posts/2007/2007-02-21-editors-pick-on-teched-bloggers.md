I just noticed that my [Tech·Ed Technical Tracks Summary]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-teched-technical-tracks-summary %}) post was just listed as a TechEd Bloggers [Editor's Pick](http://techedbloggers.net/Editors_Picks.category) for Sunday, February 18.

I also received some feedback from Rob Relyea, the Program Manager for the WPF Team ([http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com](http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com)) regarding my [Tech·Ed Technical Tracks - Where's WPF?]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-17-teched-technical-tracks-wheres-wpf %}) post stating that they are working on fixing this issue. I'm looking forward to seeing the updated sessions covering WPF.
