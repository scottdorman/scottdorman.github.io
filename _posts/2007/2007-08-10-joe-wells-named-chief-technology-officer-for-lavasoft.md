I just found out that my good friend Joe Wells has accepted an offer from [Lavasoft](http://www.lavasoft.com/) to be the new Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Joe is very well known for his extensive career in the software security field, having authored more than 60 technical papers andÂ founding the [WildList Organization International](http://www.wildlist.org). He has worked with such well-known companies as Symantec, IBM, and Sunbelt Software.

According to the [press release](http://www.lavasoft.com/company/press/archive/20070810.php), he "will lead all technical initiatives for Lavasoft, including development and research for existing solutions as well as new industry advancements."

I think Joe will fit the position of CTO very well and wish him a heart-felt congratulations.
