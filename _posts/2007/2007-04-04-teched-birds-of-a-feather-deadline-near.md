[Apparently](http://www.ferncrk.com/blog/2007/04/02/TechEd2007BirdsofaFeatherProposalsDueThisWeek.aspx), this Friday (April 6) is the last day to submit Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session topics for TechÂ·Ed 2007. Having attended several BOF sessions over the last few years, I decided to submit one of my own for this year. 

The topic I chose is titled "Code Styles and Standards - Best Practices?". The idea for this session is to talk about code standards and style guidelines, which can usually be a very volatile topic. I hope that by getting a group of relative strangers together we can talk about what our experiences have been with code standards and styles, what worked, what didn't, and why having them is a good idea. Along the way, maybe we'll discover some "best practices" and some creative ways to make introducing standards at your company a little bit easier.

Make sure to [submit](https://www.msteched.com/BOF/SubmitBOF.aspx) your topics and don't forget to [vote](https://www.msteched.com/BOF/Voting.aspx).
