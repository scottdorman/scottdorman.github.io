[WPCentral](http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-encouraging-android-windows-10-app-ports-cortana-notifications) and [MS Power User](http://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-using-cortana-android-notification-sync-encourage-developers-make-uwp-apps/) both reported that Microsoft is using the notification sync feature of Cortana in Windows 10 to add a "Request app" button if the notification comes from an Android phone. (This is currently only available if you're running the Insider builds of 'Redstone', but should presumably be coming to all Windows users with the Anniversary Update later this summer.)

The idea is to encourage more Android apps to come to the Windows Store by showing the level of use/interest for the app to the developers and the "Request app" link goes to the [WinStore Requests UserVoice](https://winstorerequests.uservoice.com/) page where anyone can recommend that an app be added to the Windows Store. 

What's even nicer, in my opinion at least, is that this UserVoice site is the one that I started nearly 4 years ago for this very purpose. I never expected that it would be picked up in this way though. Needless to say, I'm more than a little bit flattered and humbled.

Since the news articles posted, there have been over 75 new requests, over 20 new comments, and over 100 new votes. I have also read the comments on the WPCentral and MS Power User articles, some of which talk about wanting better integration. I have already reached out to Microsoft to get in contact with the responsible team to talk about this very topic and find how how we can work together to improve things. I'll also be reviewing the content and requests already on the site to make sure they are up to date (but since I'm the only one responsible for the UserVoice site, please bear with me on the timing.)
