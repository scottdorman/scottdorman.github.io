Several years ago I was in need of some logo design services for one of my projects. Since I'm not a graphics designer, I knew I would need to use a design service. As a result, I turned to my attention to a web search and started investigating my options. What I found was that there are a **lot** of offerings available and that prices and quality seemed to vary widely.

I eventually decided to use [logoglo](http://www.logoglo.com/) and (jumping ahead several years and several logos later) couldn't be happier with that choice. Logoglo gives you premium service and a premium product without the premium price. There are several different pricing options to choose from and all of them include unlimited changes once the initial design has been selected. (You initially get 5 designs to pick from and narrow it down from there.)

I have now used logoglo for a couple of different projects; some have been a simple logo and social media avatar and others have been the full range of logo, social media, business cards, letterhead, and a logo suitable for embroidery.

I'm very happy with the quality, professionalism and turnaround time of the logoglo team and they have definitely become my "go-to" service for logo design. (In fact, I'm about to use them for another project - more on that in a later post.)
