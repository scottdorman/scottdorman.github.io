Over the last few weeks I've been making some improvements to my blog. One of those improvements was an update to the theme.

When I originally [moved my blog]({% post_url /2016/2016-03-23-moving-to-github-pages %}) I used a layout based
on [beautiful-jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) and [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Now that Bootstrap 4 has been out for a while, I decided to update the layout to support it. Those changes have resulted in a brand new Jekyll theme called [Danvers](https://github.com/scottdorman/danvers).

Danvers is a ready-to-use Jekyll template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal sites, blogs, or simple project websites. It's still based on [beautiful-jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), but has been simplified, restructured some, minor improvements made, and updated to work with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com).

The benefit of updating to Bootstrap 4 is that the CSS and HTML structure have become simpler and cleaner, using more of what Bootstrap has built-in. Since it's built using Bootstrap, it looks great on both large and small screen devices. 

It should support both user pages and project pages easily by taking advantage of the `baseurl` parameter in the `config.yml` file.

My blog doesn't completely use Danvers yet (I created the theme after I'd updated the blog layout) but I will be working on converging the two over the next few weeks. That means my blog will become a better example of what the theme can do and the theme will gain some of the additional features I have in my blog.

For questions and issues with the theme, please look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/scottdorman/danvers/issues). If you don't see what you're looking for, go ahead and a [new issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/danvers/issues/new).

If want to contribute in any way, feel free to create a pull request.

If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate it if you keep the link in the footer to this project.
