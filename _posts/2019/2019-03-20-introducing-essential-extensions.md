It's been several years (and a few Visual Studio versions) since I last blogged about my [favorite visual studio extensions]({% post_url /2014/2014-10-05-favorite-visual-studio-extensions %}) and a lot has changed since then. This time around, rather than just listing my favorites, I decided to create some public [Visual Studio Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/ScottDorman) that make it easy to get Visual Studio setup with all of the different extensions.

I'm officially introducing Essential Extensions, which are a set of extension packs to create the ultimate Visual Studio editor experience. These extension packs require Visual Studio 2017 Update 8 or newer.

Each extension pack in Essential Extensions has a different focus.
