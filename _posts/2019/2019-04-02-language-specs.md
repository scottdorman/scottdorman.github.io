Nearly [two years ago]({% post_url 2017/2017-02-11-language-specs-info %}) I introduced [Language Specs](https://www.languagespecs.info/). At that time, I'd been helping Microsoft move their language specs for C# and VB to markdown and hosted on GitHub. The website acts as your "one stop shop" for finding the official language specs for a variety of popular programming languages. The specs themselves aren't hosted here, that is still left up to the individual language maintainers.

I've just updated the site, which included moving to a fully GitHub Pages hosted site, and added 10 new languages. 

If you want to suggest an additional language spec be added to the site, simply [fork the repo](https://github.com/scottdorman/languagespecs.info/fork) and submit a pull request or [submit an issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/languagespecs.info/issues).
