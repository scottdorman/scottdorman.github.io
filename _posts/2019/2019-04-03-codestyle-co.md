Nearly [five years ago]({% post_url 2014/2014-07-25-announcing-codestyle-co %}) I introduced [codestyle.co](https://www.codestyle.co/). Code style and standards has long been of mine. I've helped a lot of different companies create and adopt code standards and I frequently talk about them at various code camps and user groups. 

Many of the problems I saw at the time still exist today and [codestyle.co](https://www.codestyle.co/) continues to be a centralized place to find standards for various programming languages and (through GitHub [issues](https://github.com/scottdorman/codestyle.co/issues/)) foster a discussion around what those standards should be.

I've just updated the site so that it's fully hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll. This means that when new standards are added, the site is automatically update and gives me an easier way to mantain both the standards and the site code.

If you want to suggest an additional language standard be added to the site or update an existing standards document, simply [fork the repo](https://github.com/scottdorman/codestyle.co/fork) and submit a pull request or [submit an issue](https://github.com/scottdorman/codestyle.co/issues).
