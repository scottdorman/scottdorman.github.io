Yesterday, both [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) and 
[GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/) had a significant announcement. Sometime later this year, Microsoft will be acquiring GitHub!

It's incredible that in the ten years since GitHub started it has become one of the most dominant players in cloud-based online source control and that Microsoft is now the most active organization on GitHub in the world. Not only that, but VS Code is built using GitHub's Electron platform, and Microsoft also contributes back into the GitHub infrastructure, most notably with Electron and Git LFS.

This is a massive shakeup in the cloud-based online source control world, but I think it's also a significant one. As Satya said in his announcement, `Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the worldâ€™s code. And GitHub is their home.` I'm excited to see where this takes not just GitHub but Microsoft and the entire developer ecosystem.

I hope that this means even tighter integration between Visual Studio and GitHub and better tooling for GitHub as well. Specifically, I'd love to see the Visual Studio Online services move to support GitHub properly (and not an internal version of Git like they do now) so that things like gated check-ins and build pipelines will work against a GitHub repository.

Although most of my code is already in GitHub, using both public and private repos, I'll be moving the remainder of my TFS-based code repos to GitHub in the coming weeks.

Congratulations to GitHub and Microsoft both on this new partnership.
