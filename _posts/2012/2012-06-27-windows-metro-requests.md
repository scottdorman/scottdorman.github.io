Windows 8 and Windows Metro style apps have a lot of potential, but only if application vendors realize there is a demand to see their app as a Metro style app and not just as a desktop app (or worse, only as an Android or iOS app). As consumers, the only thing we can do is be vocal about our desire to see these apps on Windows 8 as a Metro style app.

In an effort to raise awareness, I just launched [WinMetro Requests](http://winmetrorequests.uservoice.com/). This is our opportunity to request Windows Metro style appsÂ  and show those companies just how much interest there is for seeing their app as a Metro style app.

This site is running on UserVoice, so it allows you to easily submit application requests, add comments, and, **more importantly, vote** for your favorite applications to come to Windows as a Metro style app!

As I find out the status of requested applications, I will update the status of the request. If you know and have official communication from one of the companies indicating they will be or are working on a Windows Metro style app, please let me know and I'll update the status of the request after verifying (or at least trying to verify) the information.
