For those of you who may not know, [appRequests](http://apprequests.azurewebsites.net/) is the umbrella brand for [WP Requests](http://wprequests.uservoice.com/) and [WinStore Requests](http://winstorerequests.uservoice.com/). These sites are designed to allow you to add or vote for your favorite non-Microsoft app to come to either the Windows Phone or Windows Store platforms. It’s a great way to show companies that there really is an interest in seeing official apps.

> Not seeing the app you want in the Windows or Windows Phone Store? Here is you’re opportunity to request applications on the Windows platform as a Windows Store or Windows Phone app!

Being part of the MVP Showcase is a huge success for these sites. Out of 3,800 MVPs there were only 20 selected to be part of the Showcase. If you’re going to be at Summit, be sure to check out the Showcase on Sunday night (February 17th from 16:00 – 19:00 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel Grand Ballroom in Bellevue)…and be sure to stop by my booth and say hello. I’ll have business cards you can take to hand out to others and stickers for your laptops or tablets.
