## SharePoint Architectural Perspectives

While SharePoint does have the one-button install option, it isn't a monolithic application that just gets dropped on a server. SharePoint has a number of moving pieces that should be understood by both infrastructure and application architects. In this session, we'll review the architectural makeup of SharePoint's infrastructure, as well as the components of a custom SharePoint solution. A thoughtfully-designed SharePoint architecture can be the difference between smashing success and humiliating failure.

**Speaker:** David McNamee, SharePoint Technical Specialist, Microsoft Corp.

**Please be aware that the location has changed from the Microsoft office to Kforce. The Kforce office is near Ybor City, so make sure to allow some extra time for traffic.**

*Please be sure to register if you plan on attending the meeting. We use the registration numbers so we have an idea of how many pizzas to order. We also use the registrations as a "second chance entry" for the drawing at the end of the meeting (but you must register and show up, of course).*
