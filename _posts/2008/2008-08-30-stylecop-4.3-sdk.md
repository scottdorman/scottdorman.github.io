Not too long ago I [mentioned]({% post_url 2008-08-19-stylecop-4.3-released %}) that [StyleCop](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/sourceanalysis) 4.3 had been released and that the SDK documentation would be out shortly. The wait is over and the SDK documentation is now [available](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=sourceanalysis&ReleaseId=1425).

The documentation covers the following sections:

*   Writing Custom Rules for StyleCop
*   Integrating StyleCop into Build Environments
*   StyleCop API Reference  

I'm looking forward to finding some time to sit down with the SDK and see what kind of custom rules I can write.
