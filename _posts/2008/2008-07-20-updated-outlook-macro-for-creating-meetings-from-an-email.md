Only a few hours ago I [posted]({% post_url /2008/2008-07-20-outlook-macro-for-creating-meetings-from-an-email %} "Click To View Entry") and Outlook macro for creating meetings from an email. I've already updated it with some new features (requested by me, of course). The new version is [available](http://cid-93d618d639ec9651.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Office%202007%20Macros/OutlookMacros.bas) on my [SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/) account and has the following new features:

*   You can now create either a meeting or an appointment â€“ there are two macros now.
*   The reminder time has been changed to 10 minutes (bug fix).
*   The original email message is now an attachment, which means the body of the appointment or meeting is blank.
*   The code has been simplified a bit more.  

Just like the previous version, I make no guarantees or warranties on this macro. I have tested it on several different email messages and other Outlook items and it seems to work and not cause any problems, but, as always, use with caution. Since it is a macro, you have the full source code available to investigate and see what it's actually doing. If you find any bugs or make any useful changes, please let me know and I'll update the macro.
