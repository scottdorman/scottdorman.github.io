More announcements from Mix came from [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/), who announced the release of Silverlight 2 Beta 1. (In case you don't know, [Silverlight 2 was previously called Silverlight 1.1]({% post_url /2007/2007-11-30-silverlight-2-0 %})) 

This release provides a lot of new features and controls, including layout containers such as a Grid and StackPanel, control skinning and templating. There are improvements in both networking and general performance as well. 

Better integration with Visual Studio 2008 is also provided as well as a new release of [Expression Blend](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/download.aspx?key=blend2dot5). 

One of the early adopters of the Silverlight 2 Beta 1 release is the Dr. Popper [game](http://www.bluerosegames.com/brg/games.aspx) from Blue Rose Games. Dr. Popper is a puzzle game similar to Bubblet or Jawbreaker. Connect pieces of the same color, the more the better.
