A few months ago I [talked]({% post_url 2007-11-06-Microsoft-Sync-Framework %}) about the [Microsoft Sync Framework](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/sync/default.aspx). One part of that Framework is [Sync Services for ADO.NET](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/sync/bb887608.aspx), which enables synchronization of information between database systems. [Steve Lasker](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevelasker/archive/tags/Microsoft+Synchronization+Platform/default.aspx) has some good information on the Sync Framework and Sync Services. [Joe Healy](http://www.devfish.net/default.aspx) did a presentation on Sync Services at the [Orlando SQL Saturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com) and will be doing updated presentations at [South Florida .NET CodeCamp IV](http://codecamp08.fladotnet.com) and the [Tampa SQL Saturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com) events in February. In the meantime, be sure to check out the [slides](http://www.devfish.net/downloads/files/synch_services.zip) from his Orlando talk.
