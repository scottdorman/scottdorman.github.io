Many of you may remember that I moderated a Birds of a Feather session at TechÂ·Ed last year on Code style and standards. I am happy to announce that I will (hopefully) be moderating a follow-up session this year. From last years session, there were almost 100 people that showed up, so I hope to see you again so we can continue the discussion and find out how successful (or unsuccessful) you have been at implementing code standards and what new issues and ideas everyone has.

Here is the topic abstract:

> ***Code Style and Standards***
> 
> *Code standards and styles are one of those topics that you either love or hate. At last year's TechEd this session drew a crowd of almost 100 people from all aspects of software development. Join us again as we talk about what our experiences have been, what worked and what didn't. Along the way we can discover some "best practices" and some creative ways to make adopting code standards at your company a little bit easier.*

[Be sure to vote](https://www.msteched.com/dev/voting.aspx), but be sure to vote for the right session. Apparently some one else submitted a topic that is very similar to mine.
