I just got back from Orlando Code Camp 2008 and wanted to thank everyone who was involved in organizing it and everyone who came out to attend sessions. I believe there were about 250 people attending with about 40 speakers presenting on over 50 topics.

For those of you who attended my talks on memory management fundamentals - "Thank you!". I had a great turnout at both sessions, with about 18 people at each. I got a lot of great questions from everyone and some really good feedback as well. If you missed the talks, or attended and want a copy of the slides, they are available from my SkyDrive public folder:
