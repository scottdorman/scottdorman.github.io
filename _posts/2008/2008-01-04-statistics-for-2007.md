title: Statistics for 2007

Even though I've been blogging since June 2006, I really started consistently blogging in November of that year with it really picking up in 2007. Borrowing a concept from many of the bloggers that I read regularly, I wanted to review how my blog did over the last year. I only started tracking blog statistics through Google Analytics since the end of September 2007.

My site usage for September 2007 through December 2007 was 36,371 visits from 146 different countries. The top 5 are:

1.  United States
2.  Unite Kingdom
3.  India
4.  Canada
5.  Australia 

I had 308 posts over the course of the year, and the top 5 posts were:
 <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="597" border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">**<u>Post</u>**</td> <td valign="top" width="96">**<u>% Page views</u>**</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">[Visual Studio 2008 release date]({% post_url /2007/2007-07-10-Visual-Studio-2008-release-date %})</td> <td valign="top" width="96">6.49</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">[Windows Vista: Kernel Changes - Has any body seen Gina and what's a UAC?]({% post_url /2006/2006-06-17-windows-vista-kernel-changes-has-any-body-seen-gina-and %})</td> <td valign="top" width="96">5.87</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">[SyncToy 2.0 Beta](/2007/2007-10-26-SyncToy-2.0-Beta)</td> <td valign="top" width="96">5.43</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">[Blog home page](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/)</td> <td valign="top" width="96">4.06</td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="499">[Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition and FxCop Integration]({% post_url /2007/2007-02-18-visual-studio-2005-professional-edition-and-fxcop-integration %})</td> <td valign="top" width="96">3.72</td></tr></tbody></table> 

I don't think any really clear themes emerged from by blog topics as I ranged from Vista to C# 3.0 (.NET 3.5) to open source projects and everything in between. 

Looking back at my blog over the last year, I'm not sure that I would change anything for 2008. I want to thank everyone that has been reading my blog for and I hope you continue reading in the new year. If you haven't subscribed, make sure you do.
