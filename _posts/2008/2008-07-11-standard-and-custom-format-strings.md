I was recently asked by a co-worker what the format string was for formatting a DateTime object in an ISO 8601 format. The way to do this is passing a format string to the `ToString()` method on the DateTime object. The question becomes, what is that format string? There are two ways to do this:
 
```csharp
DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy'-'MM'-'dd'T'HH':'mm':'ss'.'fffffffK")
DateTime.Now.ToString("o")
```

At this point, you might ask how you would know to use the "o". This information is available through [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/26etazsy.aspx), but it isn't always easy to find if you don't already know where to look. Here is a quick "cheat sheet" of links to help you find the right information:
