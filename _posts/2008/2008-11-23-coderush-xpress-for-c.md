Developer Express, the makers of [CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/CodeRush), have teamed up with Microsoft to make a scaled down version available for free called [CodeRush Xpress](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/). This is exclusively for C# developers working in Visual Studio 2008 and includes a selection of hand-picked features from CodeRush and [Refactor! Pro](http://www.devexpress.com/Refactor).

A few important things to point out are that CodeRush Xpress:

*   <font color="#ff0000">does not support the Visual Studio Express Editions</font>
*   <font color="#ff0000">cannot be installed side-by-side with other CodeRush or Refactor! editions</font>  

There are about 25 refactorings, including compress to Lambda expression, convert to auto-implemented property, convert to initializer and create backing store (which converts an auto-implemented property back to a standard property).

If you've always wanted the features of CodeRush and Refactor! Pro but could never justify the cost, this is for you.
