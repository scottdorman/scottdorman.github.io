So I was supposed to go to Party with Palermo for TechEd 2007 but didn't manage to make it to town in time. Now that I know I'm going to the MVP Summit this year, I'm planning to go to the MVP Summit edition.

As always, the cover charge is one business card, which will get you in the door and registered for the grand prize drawings. This is free to attend, with free food, drink, and swag.
