I just registered for Microsoft PDC 2008 in LA, October 27-30.

This will be my second PDC and the first one I've been to as an MVP.

There are supposed to be a lot of really interesting things announced at this one, so it should be an exciting time.

I know I will be at the [Party with Palermo](http://www.partywithpalermo.com/) on October 26, and there will probably be a Florida (and Friends of Florida) MVP geek lager one night as well. Not sure what else is going on, but if you're going look me up.
