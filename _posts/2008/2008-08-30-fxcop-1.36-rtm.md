I have always been a huge fan of [FxCop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476(VS.80).aspx), especially FxCop 1.36 even though it was a beta release for a *long* time. I'm happy to say (a bit late) that FxCop 1.36 has finally been released. Some of the improvements are:

*   200+ bug fixes that reduce noise, missing analysis and rule crashes 
*   Support for [analyzing anonymous methods and lambda expressions](http://blogs.msdn.com/fxcop/archive/2007/09/21/new-for-visual-studio-2008-support-for-anonymous-methods-and-lambda-expressions.aspx)
*   [New option for skipping analysis over tool generated code](http://blogs.msdn.com/fxcop/archive/2008/02/28/faq-how-do-i-prevent-fxcop-1-36-from-firing-warnings-against-generated-code.aspx)
*   [Spell checker libraries now ship in the box](http://davesbox.com/archive/2008/06/08/fxcop-now-ships-with-the-spell-checker-libraries.aspx)
*   [Changes in the way references are resolved and located ](http://davesbox.com/archive/2008/06/10/reference-resolution-changes-in-code-analysis-and-fxcop-part-1.aspx)
*   Better support for C++/CLI and the Compact Framework 
*   Language 'friendly' API names in the UI and resolutions (ie Visual Basic syntax if running over a Visual Basic binary) 
*   New globalization, design and usage rules 
*   [New rule for targeting specific versions of the Framework](http://davesbox.com/archive/2008/08/25/new-for-visual-studio-2008-sp1-and-fxcop-1-36-multi-targeting-rule.aspx)
*   Performance improvements that cut analysis by 2x and use half as much memory 
*   Documentation that is [now available on MSDN](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476(VS.80).aspx)  

The biggest change from the beta is the addition of the "Use only API from targeted framework" rule, which enforces that you use APIs that shipped in RTM versions of a particular Framework. This is very similar to the rule that [Krzysztof](http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/archive/2007/10/02/Multi_2D00_TargetingAndFxCop.aspx) and [I]({% post_url /2007/2007-10-09-Standalone-FxCop-Multi-Targeting-Rules %}) created earlier this year. 

I'm not sure about FxCop 1.35 but the 1.36 beta will not detect the new version automatically, so you must [download it](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9aeaa970-f281-4fb0-aba1-d59d7ed09772&DisplayLang=en) directly.Â  Also, be sure to check out the [Code Analysis](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=98&SiteID=1) forum for feedback.
