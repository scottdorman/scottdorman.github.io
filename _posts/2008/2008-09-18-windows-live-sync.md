{% include post/image.html image-file="sync-3.png" alt="" %}I have talked about Windows Live FolderShare in the [past]({% post_url /2007/2007-11-21-windows-live-foldershare %} and have always really liked what it offers. As part of the new Windows Live Wave 3 release, although not an official part of the release yet, is the fact that FolderShare is being renamed and rebranded as Windows Live Sync.

As I said, its not part of the beta releases today, but you can [download](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/6/E/76EE3260-D212-4D9B-B8D6-79C014B0593B/EN/WindowsLiveSync-ship-en.cab) the beta if you want an early look. This is looks like it is still an early beta, so a lot of features don't appear to be working and I can't get it to connect through the firewall at work like FolderShare could. Still, it looks like there is a lot of promise.
