PDC 2008 starts in a few days. I've setup a preliminary schedule already, but, as always, it's subject to change once I get there. It will be good to see the early bits for Windows 7, including a Windows 7 Application Compatibility Lab.

I'm staying at the Grand Kyoto Hotel, near Little Tokyo. If anybody wants to catch up and grab some sushi, let me know.
