If you like sushi and are attending PDC 2008 in Los Angeles, then [join us for some great sushi and networking](http://sushigeekdinnerpdc2008.eventbrite.com/) Wednesday night. If you're attending The Underground @ PDC, be sure to join us since Oomasa (in Little Tokyo) is only a few blocks away. 

*The registration is free, but the sushi isn't. Prices, however are very reasonable.*
