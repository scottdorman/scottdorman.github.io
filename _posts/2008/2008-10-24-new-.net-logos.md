Just in time for PDC, Microsoft has unveiled new logos for the .NET Framework.

According to Chris Keonig's [blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/archive/2008/10/24/new-net-logos-announced-today.aspx) about the new logos, the change was made because

> We [Microsoft] needed a logo that was in sync with the key values that we want .NET to stand for: consistency, robustness and great user experiences. We also wanted a logo that conformed to the design principles that are driving Microsoft's brand identity evolution and is reflected in newer brands such as Silverlight, Surface and more.Â  Finally, we needed a logo that is more strongly aligned with the portfolio of brands that .NET is most strongly aligned with: Silverlight, Visual Studio and our server products.
