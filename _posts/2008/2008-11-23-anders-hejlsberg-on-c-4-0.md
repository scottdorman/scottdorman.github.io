If you attended [PDC](http://microsoftpdc.com/) hopefully you had a chance to hear Anders' talk on C# 4.0; if not you can [watch](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/) it on Channel 9. During that talk, one of the primary new features he focused on was the new dynamic keyword and all of the new features that come along with it. Building on that talk, Anders and C# Community PM Charlie Calvert [talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/VisualStudio/C-40-Questions-and-reasons-behind-the-answers/) about questions that have come up in the community about what the new dynamic features mean.
