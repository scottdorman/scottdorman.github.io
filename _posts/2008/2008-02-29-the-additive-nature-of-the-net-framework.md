Also from Paul's [blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/pandrew/archive/2007/11/02/announcing-the-net-framework-3-5-commonly-used-types-and-namespaces-poster.aspx) and the [.NET Framework Namespace poster]({% post_url /2008/2008-02-29-.net-framework-3.5-namespace-poster %}) is an excellent diagram that shows the relationship between the .NET Framework 3.5 release and the other versions of the Framework. This clearly shows the additive nature of both the .NET 3.0 and 3.5 releases.
