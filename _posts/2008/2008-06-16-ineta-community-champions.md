If you are a user group leader in the worldwide community of Microsoft&reg; .NET user groups, you probably already know about INETA.Â Don't know about INETA? Then you should definitely [take a look](http://www.ineta.org/About.aspx) and [become an INETA member group](http://www.ineta.org/BecomeAMember.aspx).

Are you already involved with an INETA member group? Be sure to check out the new [Community Champions](http://www.ineta.org/Champions/CommunityChampionInfo.aspx) program. This is just one of the ways INETA recognizes and rewards those who contribute to the user group community and help it grow. 

The Champs program was specifically designed to help recognize what it takes (and provide a little bit more insight for those that aren't involved) to run a successful user group community by giving you a way to record all of those tasks. In exchange for taking a few minutes to record your tasks, you become eligible for a quarterly Community Champions Award.

The Community Champions Award lasts for 12 months and offers a letter of commendation and certificate of achievement from INETA, recognition on the INETA website, and a few great prizes like an MSDN Subscription or an Xbox 360.

If you have anything to do with helping to run a user group, be sure to check it out and start submitting your tasks today. The first award period is coming up, so you might be one of the first people to win. Right now the INETA Community Champions program is only available to user groups in North America, but the Champs team is going to be working on international launches soon.
