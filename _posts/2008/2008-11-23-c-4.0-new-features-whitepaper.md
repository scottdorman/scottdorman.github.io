I've blogged a lot about the new features available in C# 4.0 recently, with each feature getting a dedicated blog post. Mads Torgersen, a C# PM and member of the C# design team, together with other members of the C# team have created a [document](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&DownloadId=3550) that outlines the new features in C# 4.0. This whitepaper, combined with [Anders' PDC talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL16/) is one of the best ways to get a good overview of what's coming.

There are also a set of C# 4.0 [samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&ReleaseId=1686&wa=wsignin1.0) available which demonstrate how to use the new language features:

*   [Dynamic Samples](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&DownloadId=3540)
*   [Covariance and Contravariance Sample](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&DownloadId=3541)
*   [IDynamicObject Sample](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&DownloadId=3575)  

All of this is available on the Code Gallery at the new [C# Future](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/csharpfuture) site, which will provide a single "go to" point of information for learning about the next version of C#.
