The Tampa Bay chapter of the International Association of Software Architects ([IASA](http://www.iasahome.org/web/home/home)) is dedicated to building a community of professionals interested in topics related to software architecture. This organization welcomes all interested professionals. Whether you are a senior enterprise architect at a fortune 100 company or an aspiring architect with only a few years of experience. 

**Please be sure to register so we have an idea of how many pizzas to order**, and remember that the outside doors lock and the elevators need a security key after 7:00 PM.

*An intro to Object Oriented development in C# will be a review for some software architects and may be a few new tricks for others. This 90-minute walk through will review the principles of OO development, examine some of the common Gang of Four design patterns, and evaluate specific examples of OO patterns in C#. Bring your questions, concerns and comments about .Net development. This walk through is ideal for those making the transition from VC++ or VB6 to .Net, or those making the leap from .Net 1.1 to .Net 2.0, 3.0 or 3.5. New language features in C# 3.0 such as anonymous types, extension methods and automatic properties will also be covered.*
