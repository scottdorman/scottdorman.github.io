## Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) using BizTalk Server 2006R2

Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) using BizTalk Server 2006R2. Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006 R2, the latest version of BizTalk, is an exciting tool that all .NET application developers should know about. BizTalk fills two key business needs: enterprise application integration, and business process automation. This session will explore the concepts surrounding application integration and how BizTalk Server 2006 R2 can be a key player in you enterprises overall SOA strategy. We will explain what BizTalk is and demonstrate how it can be used to resolve some of the most common application integration issues. Additionally, we will show how the use of adapters, maps and pipelines can be used to solve many of the challenges faced by enterprises. The session will be dynamic, easy to follow with some demos. Concepts and tools will be shown by walking through several real-world, practical examples of BizTalk usage. *(This is a 1-hour talk.)*

## Implementing and consuming SOA services with BizTalk Server 2006R2**

The concepts surrounding Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) have been out there for quite some time now. Still, architects are struggling to apply the concepts in their enterprise solutions. Concerns about scalability, maintainability and short concept-to-market development have been some of the major reasons for its slow embracement. BizTalk Server provides out-of-the-box capabilities to help you implement SOA services that are scalable, maintainable and most importantly adapt to the ever changing needs of the enterprise. This session will review some key aspects of service oriented architecture and show how BizTalk can address those concepts. We will illustrate best practices and techniques used for building enterprise ready services using BizTalk Server. *(This is a 1-hour talk.)*

**Speaker:** Danny is Senior Applications Architect specializing in enterprise integration. He brings extensive experience in various fields including manufacturing, healthcare, human resources and supply chain logistics. He consults for fortune 500 customers helping them design and build integration solutions based on BizTalk Server. He has participated in various MSDN web casts. You can catch him at [http://delriodanny.blogspot.com]() where he blogs about integration technologies.

*These are both 1-hour talks and we will have a short break in between presentations.*

**Please be aware that the location has changed from the Kforce office to the new Microsoft Gulf States office.**

*Please be sure to register if you plan on attending the meeting. We use the registration numbers so we have an idea of how many pizzas to order. Starting with this month's meeting we will also be using the registrations as a second opportunity for the giveaways at the end of the meeting. What does that mean? Simply put, if you register for the meeting (and show up, of course) you will get two "entries" in the drawing instead of one. Don't worry about registering and then not being able to make it; we would much rather order extra than not enough. You can also always email us and we'll mark you as not being able to attend.*
