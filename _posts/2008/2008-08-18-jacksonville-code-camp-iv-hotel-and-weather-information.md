For any one who is going to the Jacksonville Code Camp 2008 (Jax Code Camp IV) and is traveling be sure to keep an eye on the weather and on tropical storm Fay. It is supposed to be hitting Florida as early as Tuesday, but the forecasts don't yet know exactly where.

If you book a hotel through Hotwire (the only 4-star listed on Hotwire for downtown Jacksonville is the Hyatt) be sure to purchase the travel protection (it's only about $8) since it covers natural events like hurricanes. Otherwise, you may want to book it directly through the hotel so you can get a refund in case the weather turns really bad.
