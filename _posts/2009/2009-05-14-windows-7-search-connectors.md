![](/img/posts{{ page.path | remove: '_posts' | remove: '.md' }}/image8.png "image") Earlier I talked about the new [Windows 7 Federated Search]({% post_url /2009/2009-05-14-windows-7-federated-search %}) capabilities and mentioned that you can create your own Search connectors. Since then, I've been busy creating some search connector description files for the following sites:

*   Geekswithblogs 
*   Live Search 
*   MSDN 
*   MSDN Blogs 
*   The Code Project 
*   Channel 9 
*   Twitter   

All of these search connector descriptions are available from my SkyDrive [Search Connectors](http://cid-93d618d639ec9651.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Search%20Connectors) folder.
