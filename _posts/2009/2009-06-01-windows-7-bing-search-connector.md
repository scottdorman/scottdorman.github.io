Microsoft's latest incarnation of it's [search engine](http://www.bing.com), which has gone by a few different code names, is live a few days early.

It's still early, so it remains to be seen if Microsoft will be able to pull any search market share away from Google, but Bing looks like it may be a good start. The biggest difference is that Bing seems to offer better organization by putting the related searches list along the left side of the search results where you can see it without scrolling. It also provides a search history, and contextual information for each result.

From the Live Search blog, Bing is a

> ...new kind of search that goes beyond traditional search engines to help you make faster, more informed decisions. It will do this by combining a great search engine (with powerful new features to improve your results for any query), more organized results, and unique tools to help you make important decisions.

If you are running Internet Explorer 8, you can install Bing as your search engine through the [Add-ons Gallery](http://www.ieaddons.com/in/details/searchhelpers/Bing_Search/), for any other browser Sarah Perez has a good [summary](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_make_bing_your_default_search_engine.php) of how to accomplish this.

For Windows 7, I have created a [search connector](http://cid-93d618d639ec9651.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Search%20Connectors/Bing.osdx) you can install to integrate Bing as a federated search site.
