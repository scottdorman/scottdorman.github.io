I have [previously mentioned]({% post_url /2009/2009-06-26-sams-teach-yourself-c-2010-in-24-hours %}) that I'm working on the upcoming <u>Sams Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours</u> book.

Things are progressing nicely, if a bit slower than I'd prefer. I have the draft for the cover art, which looks really good.

I'm also very pleased to announce my technical editors: Claudio Lasaala and Eric Lippert.

[Claudio](http://claudiolassala.spaces.live.com) is a Senior Developer at [EPS Software Corp](http://eps-software.com/). He has presented several lectures at Microsoft events such as PDC and various other Microsoft seminars, as well as several conferences and user groups across North America and Brazil. He is a multiple winner of the Microsoft MVP Award and also holds the MCSD for .NET certification. He has articles published on several magazines, such as MSDN Brazil Magazine, CoDe Magazine, UTMag, Developers Magazine, and FoxPro Advisor.

[Eric](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert) is a senior software design engineer at Microsoft has been working full time in the developer division since 1996, where he assisted with the design and implementation of VBScript, JScript, JScript.NET, Windows Script Host, Visual Studio Tools for Office and C#.

I am looking forward to working with both Claudio and Eric through the technical editing process and getting this book completed and available, which should happen sometime early in 2010.
