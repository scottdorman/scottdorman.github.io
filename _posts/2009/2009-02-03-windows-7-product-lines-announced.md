Microsoft today announced the new product line for Windows 7. In some ways the new Windows 7 product line follows the same ideas of Windows Vista, but the big differences are that each Windows 7 edition is a superset of the previous edition (which means that each higher edition will have every feature of all lower editions) and they will be focusing primarily on two editions of Windows 7: Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional.

The breakdown on the different editions is:

## Windows 7 Starter
This is for price-sensitive customers with small notebooks PCs.

Key Feature list:

* Broad app and device compatibility with up to 3 concurrent applications
* Safe, reliable, and supported
* Ability to join a Home Group
* Improved taskbar and JumpLists

## Windows 7 Home Basic 
This is for customers in emerging markets only.

Key Feature list:

* **Starter features**
* **Unlimited applications**
* Live Thumbnail Previews & enhanced visual experience
* Advanced networking support (ad-hoc wireless networks and internet connection sharing)
* Mobility Center

## Windows 7 Home Premium

This is recommended for most customers (home consumers).

* **Unlimited applications**
* Aero Glass & advanced windows navigation
* Easy networking & sharing across all your PCs & devices
* Improved media format support, enhancements to Windows Media Center and media streaming, including Play To
* Multi-touch and improved handwriting recognition

## Windows 7 Professional

This is recommended for small businesses and those customers (home consumers) who want additional features and functionality useful for small business activities.

Key Feature list:

* **Home Premium features**

This is recommended for medium-to-large business and enterprise customers that choose to license Windows through Software Assurance and is available only through Microsoft Volume Licensing.

Key Feature list:

* DirectAccess provides seamless connectivity to your corporate network (requires Windows Server 2008 R2)

* Prevent unauthorized software from running with AppLocker

## Windows 7 Ultimate

Key Feature list:

* Multi-language packs

I know that looks like there are still a lot of different editions, but the key points are:

* For Consumers: Microsoft recommends Windows 7 Home Premium for most customers and Windows 7 Professional for customers who want additional features and functionality useful for small business activities. 
* For Businesses: Microsoft recommends Windows 7 Professional for most customers and Windows 7 Enterprise for medium-to-large business and enterprise customers that choose to license Windows through Software Assurance. 
* The features in each version of Windows 7 build upon the one before it. As customers move up from one edition to the next, from Windows 7 Starter through Windows 7 Ultimate, they ***gain additional features and lose none***.
