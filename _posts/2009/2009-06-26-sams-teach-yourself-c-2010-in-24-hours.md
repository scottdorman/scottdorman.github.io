I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Sams Teach Yourself books, at least in passing if not in owning one. I am very excited to announce that I will be joining the Sams Publishing authoring team for their upcoming <u>Teach Yourself C# 2010 in 24 Hours</u> book.

This new edition will be quite a bit different from the previous editions since it will be much more language-focused and will take a more holistic view of the language. If you have already looked at one of the earlier editions and decided that it wasn't for you, please give the new edition a chance to change your mind; for those of you who already have an earlier edition, I hope this one will be of interest to you as well.

As it gets closer to the release date, I'll be sure to let everyone know when it will be available.

I also want to thank [Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net/blog/), [Shawn Weisfeld](http://drowningintechnicaldebt.com/blogs/ShawnWeisfeld/default.aspx), [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/), and [Krzysztof Cwalina](http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/) for providing some excellent feedback on the table of contents.
