![LosTechiesLogo](/img/posts{{ page.path | remove: '_posts' | remove: '.md' }}/lostechieslogo_2.png) A few days ago I was invited by the [Los Techies](http://www.lostechies.com/) website to start [blogging](scottdorman.github.io) with them. Have no fear, I am not abandoning my home here on Geeks With Blogs, but I will be cross-posting between GWB and Los Techies.

I haven't finished setting everything up yet, but I've already put a few posts out there. Be sure to check out the site. It looks to be a young but thriving online community and I'm looking forward to seeing where they take things.
