I don't know why or how I missed this earlier, but I just found out about the Fit in February Developer Challenge. After reading the [official rules](http://calebjenkins.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/official-rules/), which includes a brief explanation of why the challenge was started, I think this is an excellent way to entice us developers in to doing something to become more healthy.

For my part, I'm going to start following the [onehundredpushups](http://hundredpushups.com/) program, which is a 6 week training program after which you should be able to do 100 consecutive pushups. I had completed about 3 weeks of it last year before "real life" got in the way and I stopped. I'm also going back on a pseudo-diet, which means I'm going to simply start eating out less (which will save money anyway), eating healthier, and eating smaller portions.
