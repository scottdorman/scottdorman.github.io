I'm still waiting for an "official" announcement, but if you are an MSDN subscriber you will be able to download [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/australia/visualstudio/products/2010/default.mspx) Beta 1 later today (May 18), probably around 12:00 PM (PST). If you aren't an MSDN subscriber, you will be able to download Beta 1 on May 20 through Microsoft Downloads.
