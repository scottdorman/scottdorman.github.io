About two years ago I [talked]({% post_url /2007/2007-12-31-disappearing-system-tray-icons-on-windows-vista %}) about a very common problem in Windows Vista where the network, volume, and power icons in the system tray disappear. In that post, I provide a solution which involves editing the registry. Several people posted comments that provide slightly more automated ways to make the registry changes through a batch/command file and through a registry file.

Jump ahead to today and Microsoft has a [Fix it solution](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945011) for this problem.
