Microsoft has reached a critical milestone in the Windows 7 development cycle with the limited release of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (RC) today for Microsoft TechNet and MSDN subscribers and general availability from the Microsoft Download Center on May 5th.

There has been a lot of excitement about Windows 7 and, so far, the excitement has been justified. The Windows 7 RC comes after extensive beta testing and feedback from the MVP community with a lot of enhancements and bug fixes since the last beta release. Some Windows 7 beta facts:

*   Over 2000 MVPs participated in the beta on Connect. 
*   MVPs contributed and filed over 700 bugs in the first week the beta was released. 
*   Engineering fixed over 2000 bugs during the first two weeks. 
*   The Windows 7 Forum was the premier destination support beta testers with over 25k posts in the first month 
*   Windows 7 Beta forums success continues to be moderated by 100+ MVPs. 
*   Windows 7 Beta forums answer rate soars to 88% on a volume of more than 40,000 posts. 
*   Highlights of positive feedback from beta testers:  Windows 7 beta speed / responsiveness, taskbar, and UX are top rated early features.   

**Reporting Bugs on Windows 7 RC**

The Windows 7 Feedback Tool is a pre-release only tool.  As a result, Microsoft has removed the launch UI for the Feedback Tool, however the tool itself is still in the RC build.  If you need to report a bug that falls into one of the categories mentioned below, you may run the following command to start the Feedback Tool: 

```
rundll32.exe FeedbackTool.dll,ShowWizard
```

If you would rather, you may create a desktop shortcut to the Feedback Tool command by right-clicking on your desktop, selecting New, Shortcut, then entering  "rundll32.exe FeedbackTool.dll,ShowWizard" (less the quotes) in the "Type the location of the item" field.  Then click Next, provide a shortcut name (for example, "Send Feedback"), then click Finish.  You may then launch the Feedback Tool from the desktop shortcut.

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note - Please be sure you have activated your copy of Windows 7 using your product key PRIOR to using the Windows Feedback Tool.</b></div>

While testing indicates that the Release Candidate is a very solid build Microsoft does ask that you be on the lookout for any issues that might remain. <u>When filing bugs on Windows 7 RC only report the following types of issues:</u>

*   Issues that prevent installation or upgrade 
*   Any issues that involve corruption or data loss 
*   Security issues 
*   Regressions from Beta (Things worked in beta but do not work now) 
*   Any application or device issues that would prevent you from using Windows 7 as your primary OS. 
*   Reproducible crashes or hangs (issues that you cannot reproduce will be captured by CEIP Telemetry)
