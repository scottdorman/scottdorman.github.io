Following last years [post]({% post_url /2009/2009-03-01-mvp-summit-2009-twitters %}) of people at MVP Summit 2009 on Twitter, I'm getting a bit of a head start and using the new [Twitter Lists](http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/76460) feature to create a [list of all Microsoft MVPs](http://twitter.com/sdorman/microsoft-mvp) that I know (or know of). I've started this list with the same people from last years blog post. The plan is for this list to be a complete list (or at least as complete as I can make it) of Microsoft MVPs. If you are an MVP and want to be included or if you know of any MVPs that should be included, please let me know. (If you are on the list and are no longer an MVP or don't want to be included, please let me know as well and I'll remove you.)
