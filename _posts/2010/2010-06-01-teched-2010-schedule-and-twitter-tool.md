If you have a mobile device ([Windows Mobile 6.5](https://marketplace.windowsphone.com/details.aspx?appId=6f3335e8-d03c-486b-b47a-068b16fafac3&retURL=/categories.aspx%3FcategoryId%3D50126%26pid%3D50077), Android, iPhone), a tablet (Windows 7, iPad), or even a laptop (Windows Vista or Windows 7 [gadgets](http://eventmgr.slsys.net/TechEd2010.gadget)) then this tool is essential.
