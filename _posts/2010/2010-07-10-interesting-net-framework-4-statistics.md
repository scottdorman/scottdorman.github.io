Last September while I was working on my [Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours](http://amzn.to/28JX8n4) book for Sams Publishing, I [posted]({% post_url /2009/2009-09-20-interesting-net-framework-statistics %}) some interesting statistics for the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. Now that the .NET Framework 4.0 has been released, I thought I would update these statistics (and thanks to Lisa for asking about them).

There were a total of 44,346 types (loaded from 130 assemblies), with 33,152 classes, 2,398 interfaces, 4,828 enums, and 8,796 value types. The complete breakdown is shown below.

Of the 33,152 classes, 564 of them are exceptions. There are 428 public and 136 non-public exceptions. The complete breakdown is shown below.
