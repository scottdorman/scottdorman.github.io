I am very happy to announce that the core content for my upcoming <u>Sams Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours</u> book is done!

I still need to incorporate comments from [Claudio](http://claudiolassala.spaces.live.com) and [Eric](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert) (my technical editors) and then incorporate edits from the Sams editors, but all of the really hard work is now done.

Even though I knew before starting that it would not be easy I don't think I was really prepared for just how difficult it is to actually write a book. I started actually writing around mid-July 2009, so it has taken about 7 months (however, the process actually startedÂ  mid-April 2009). I am currently weighing in at 476 content pages, but the final page count will be a bit higher due to the front and back matter (table of contents, index, etc.) and a forward that Eric has graciously agreed to write.

Working with Sams has been a great experience. Working with both Claudio and Eric has been great as well; they have both provided an incredible amount of comments and insight. I also want to thank [Keith Elder](http://keithelder.net/blog/), [Shawn Weisfeld](http://drowningintechnicaldebt.com/blogs/ShawnWeisfeld/default.aspx), [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/), and [Krzysztof Cwalina](http://blogs.msdn.com/kcwalina/) for their early input on the table of contents (Although I did end up changing the table of contents slightly from what they originally saw, the majority of it is still the same and without their input I would have had a much harder time focusing the content.)

The book should hopefully be on the shelves sometime around April, in time for the official launch of Visual Studio 2010 and C# 4. If you have already looked at one of the earlier editions and decided that it wasn't for you, please give the new edition a chance to change your mind; for those of you who already have an earlier edition, I hope this one will be of interest to you as well. This new edition is quite a bit different from the previous ones by being much more language-focused and taking a more holistic view of the language by focusing on what is in the language now rather than showing how the language evolved.
