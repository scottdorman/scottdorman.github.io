If you're going to TechEd North America this year, Sams Publishing will be giving away 9 advanced reader copies. In order to win a copy, be sure to follow the [InformIT Twitter account](http://twitter.com/InformIT) and the [#TechEd hash tag](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23TechEd). Sporadically throughout the day a tweet will be sent out stating that the first person who comes to the booth and mentions my [book](http://amzn.to/28JX8n4) will get a copy. The give away will probably occur over multiple days, so be sure to keep an eye on Twitter.
