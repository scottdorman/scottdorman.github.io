Woke up this morning to an email letting me know that I've been renewed as an MVP in C# again this year! Almost didn't see it as my junk mail filters kicked in and delivered it to my junk folder. Need to fix those rules. :) This makes the third year in a row that I've been an MVP. It seems like it was just yesterday when I received that first email.

The last year (especially the last half) has been very busy working on the book and my blogging and discussion board activity have slowed down a lot. As soon as the book is done I'll be back to a more normal "schedule." Thanks for everyone's patience waiting for more blog posts and the book!
