Regular readers may have noticed that my blogging activity has slowed down considerably. I’m hoping to pick back up and start posting more soon, but until then I wanted to make sure everyone knows that I am still active…there have been other things that have been consuming my time.

First, my [Sams Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672331012?ie=UTF8&tag=scotdorm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0672331012) book came out, officially on the shelves in August although content was complete in late February. Shortly after the book came out, I started working on an article for InformIT on Code Contracts in .NET 4, which should be out sometime this month (hopefully), check my [author page](http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=b863285e-a956-470e-b174-e50da14a06db) on the InformIT site for the article link when it is available. As if that weren’t enough, I’m working on a [Sams Teach Yourself Windows Phone 7 Application Development in 24 Hours](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0672335395?ie=UTF8&tag=scotdorm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0672335395) book with [Joe Healy](http://www.devfish.net/), [Kevin Wolf](http://new.efficientcoder.net/), and [Nikita Polyakov](http://geekswithblogs.net/campuskoder/Default.aspx). The book is scheduled to be out early 2011, but we’re hoping to be out earlier than that.

Realizing that I hadn’t spread myself quite thin enough, I’m also working as the Community Manager and Senior Editor for [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com). It’s basically my role to help promote the site, develop the online community around the site, bring in story submissions, and generally get people excited about the site again. If you haven’t checked out the site (or it’s been a while since you’ve been there), give it a look. We’re working on some pretty cool improvements that I hope you’ll like.

There are also a few projects that I’m working on that I don’t want to mention yet since they are still in the planning stages. Once these get going (it’s taking a while because everyone involved has real lives and jobs that have to come first), I’ll talk more about them, but let’s just say that hard-core .NET developers will really love one of them, developer community leaders (user groups, code camp organizers, etc.) should love the other one, and the third one has the potential to change how MVPs and Microsoft communicate. Of course, no pressure for any of these, right?
