"Do. Or do not. There is no try." That line is probably one of the most quoted lines from *The Empire Strikes Back*. 
Henry Ford said, "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't&mdash; you're right." It's all about belief and vision. If you believe you can accomplish a goal, then you'll be able to accomplish it because, consciously or not, you're going to take actions that move you toward that accomplishment. However, if you don't believe you can accomplish a goal, the same thing will happen, and you're going to take actions, consciously or not, that move you further from achieving it.
