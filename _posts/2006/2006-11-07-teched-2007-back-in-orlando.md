Just noticed this, apparently it was announced several weeks ago, but TechEd 2007 is now back in Orlando instead of [New Orleans]({% post_url /2006/2006-10-13-teched-2007-is-not-in-new-orleans-anymore %}).

> Microsoft has made the difficult decision not to hold TechEd 2007 in New Orleans. With this event drawing a large number of attendees from around the world and with the airlines only servicing the city with about half of their pre-Katrina flights, the logistics of moving that large a group into and out of the city is challenging and would likely result in travel and logistical challenges for attendees.
