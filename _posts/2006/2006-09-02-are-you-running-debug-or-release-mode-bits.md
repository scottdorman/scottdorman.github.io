Have you ever wanted to know if a compiled assembly was compiled in Debug or Release mode? I know I have.

I came across a post on [Computer Zen](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToProgrammaticallyDetectIfAnAssemblyIsCompiledInDebugOrReleaseMode.aspx)Â today that shows exactly how to do this. There is also a similar tool written by Jeff Key, called [IsDebug](http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/IsDebug/).

For my part, I always make sure that the following snippet of code is in my AssemblyInfo.cs

```csharp
#if (Debug || DEBUG)
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("Debug")]
#else
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("Release")]
#endif
```

This attribute doesn't show up in the file properties (when viewed from Explorer) but it can be queried programmatically.
