Earlier today Microsoft released the [newest version](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=10CC340B-F857-4A14-83F5-25634C3BF043&displaylang=en) of the .NET Framework. If you have any previous beta versions installed, you must uninstall them before installing the final release. Make sure to install the Visual Studio 2005 extensions for [.NET Framework 3.0 (WCF & WPF), November 2006 CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F54F5537-CC86-4BF5-AE44-F5A1E805680D&displaylang=en) as well. The earlier builds will not recognize the release version of the framework.
